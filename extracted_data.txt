"A step ahead of cataclysm." - Ryze
"Fine." - Ryze
"I find the runes so they won't be found by someone else - or some thing." - Ryze
"The things I've seen in the dark corners of Runeterra are better left unseen." - Ryze
"Things to do today: find food, build shelter, fix the world." - Ryze
"I sense another rune, but where?" - Ryze
"Can we make this quick? I have some place to be!" - Ryze
"If I sound rude, it's because I've got a world to save." - Ryze
"Keep your distance." - Ryze
"I read the runes. You lose." - Ryze
"Blood will spill." - Ryze
"Makers guide me!" - Ryze
"They come for the scroll." - Ryze
"Time dwindles." - Ryze
"Are you following me?" - Ryze
"You know nothing of loss." - Ryze
"I am just a vessel." - Ryze
"A fine edge you dance on." - Ryze
"By will." - Ryze
"I don't have time for this!" - Ryze
"If you insist." - Ryze
"This ends badly." - Ryze
"This might burn." - Ryze
"Hands off the runes." - Ryze
"They have no idea." - Ryze
"Leave now." - Ryze
"Ah, the hard way." - Ryze
"Stay back." - Ryze
"Away." - Ryze
"You've got nothing." - Ryze
"You won't win this." - Ryze
"Last chance." - Ryze
"Let's have it, then." - Ryze
"These runes are not for eyes such as yours." - Ryze
"They know so little of the world they traverse." - Ryze
"Ah, Runeterrans. So endearing, so foolish." - Ryze
"I work alone. Company weighs me down." - Ryze
"What's on my back? That's not your concern." - Ryze
"Knowledge is a real weapon." - Ryze
"Every rune I find is another day we live." - Ryze
"Blessing or curse, what's the difference?" - Ryze
"They have forgotten the fires that forged this world." - Ryze
"You know what I could use? An ale." - Ryze
"They want to read my scroll. It'll be the last thing they read." - Ryze
"I could tell you what's on this scroll, but then I'd have to obliterate you." - Ryze
"The wise seek to contain power." - Ryze

"All that binds this world is will." - Ryze
"Magic dooms us... but perhaps it can save us." - Ryze
"Do not walk through history. Run." - Ryze
"Power changes everyone." - Ryze
"One can only hold all this power for so long." - Ryze
"If I had a rune for every mile I've run, I'd be done running." - Ryze
"You want to help? Get out of the way." - Ryze
"I remember when only one world weighed on my shoulders." - Ryze
"When I've found them all, I'll fade away." - Ryze
"If I fall, the scroll must be destroyed." - Ryze
"I fight so they don't have to." - Ryze
"Roast duck, warm fire... someday." - Ryze
"Quickly but carefully." - Ryze
"The runes decide my path." - Ryze
"My story? That would take ages to tell." - Ryze
"Consider yourself lucky for the days you have." - Ryze

"Fast and lean, that's how I travel." - Ryze

"No time to talk." - Ryze
"I like my tragedy narrowly averted." - Ryze
"All this would be so much easier if I didn't give a damn." - Ryze
"Hm. I'm hunted by things far worse than you." - Ryze
"I'm no doctor, but I think there's a spell for what you have." - Ryze
"To be ignorant is to be free. You must be very free." - Ryze
"If I had a tattoo that looked like you, I'd get it removed." - Ryze
"There's gonna be two sounds - me hitting you, and you disintegrating." - Ryze
"You wage your petty war, Noxian, but the real war is yet to come." - Ryze
"Even your kind will know death in the cataclysm." - Ryze
"Your charms are impressive, but I'm not into forest creatures." - Ryze
"Run along, child, this tome is not a bedtime story." - Ryze
"Space called, it wants its arrogant jerk back." - Ryze
"I don't suppose you'd want to get off your magical rear and help me save this world." - Ryze
"I have a hard time believing you went to medical school." - Ryze
"I would chide you for your idiocy, but you seem pretty proud of it." - Ryze
"Nice tattoos, do they conduct runic energy? No? Oh, that's too bad." - Ryze
"Magic is more than sunshine and rainbows, girl." - Ryze
"Hey, you're the one who summons bloodthirsty Void creatures, right? Yeah, brilliant work, good thinking." - Ryze
"Nice card trick, do you do birthday parties?" - Ryze
"That remarkable arcane energy doesn't run through your entire body, does it?" - Ryze
"We'll see how smart your mouth is when the world collapses." - Ryze
"I'm surprised you can string enough words together for that one. You need a break?" - Ryze
"So that's what you people do with your spare time." - Ryze
"Not going to dignify that with a response." - Ryze
"You should read more, expand your vocabulary." - Ryze
"What? You want to see a magic trick? Fine... tada." - Ryze
"Okay, fine, here's a magic trick. Tada." - Ryze
"There it is." - Ryze
"Release." - Ryze
"Zap." - Ryze

"There!" - Ryze
"Our fight is elsewhere." - Ryze
"A rune mage must keep moving." - Ryze
"Come. The runes beckon." - Ryze
"Flee if you want to live." - Ryze
"Let's go, let's go!" - Ryze
An eagle screech is heard. - Ryze
"That's gonna' load me down." - Ryze
"Great, more things to carry." - Ryze
"This better work." - Ryze
"Provisions purchased." - Ryze
"Fuel for the rune race." - Ryze
"Now I'll never tire." - Ryze
"Sweet rune juice." - Ryze
"It's a start." - Ryze
"Fundamental." - Ryze
"Brings out my colour." - Ryze
"Even the gods can weep." - Ryze
"Now we're talking." - Ryze
"I remember when such tears were shed." - Ryze
"I can feel its power surging." - Ryze
"I'd destroy it - if I didn't need it." - Ryze
"Such a weapon must be treated with respect." - Ryze
"I defy swords and arrows." - Ryze
"Their weapons will fail to scratch." - Ryze
"Protection from primitive arms." - Ryze
"An object of foul origins." - Ryze
"Many lives it's taken, and many souls." - Ryze
"Strange how it beckons." - Ryze
"Such a vile text - but useful." - Ryze
"Not a book for the faint of heart." - Ryze
"A sordid relic from a brutal time." - Ryze
"To cover my bald spot." - Ryze
"A hat with a face, huh? Sure, why not?" - Ryze
"A potent haberdashery." - Ryze
"In case my head gets cold." - Ryze
"I thought that guy would never stop talking." - Ryze
"Always learning, always seeking." - Ryze
"Those who seek improvement, improve." - Ryze
"To the next one." - Ryze
"This power continues to build." - Ryze
"Another joins the energy pool." - Ryze
"Better you than me." - Ryze
"They never learn." - Kled
"Another dead fool." - Ryze
"One more needless death." - Ryze
"Learn from your mistakes." - Ryze
"Won't be the last." - Ryze
"That's what happens when you piss off an archmage!" - Ryze
"Better a few perish than the entire world." - Ryze
"I tried to warn them, I really did." - Ryze
"They make the same mistakes again and again." - Ryze
"Too many have met the same fate." - Ryze
"One less thing to kill me." - Ryze
"Another barrier down." - Ryze
"Let's move, the path is clear." - Ryze
"One less impediment." - Ryze
"Reduced to rubble." - Ryze
"What is made can be unmade." - Ryze
"Sight is better than swords." - Ryze
"For whatever lurks behind me." - Ryze
"If I can see it, I can beat it." - Ryze
"They come for what I know." - Ryze
"Sight makes might." - Ryze
"Watching the watchers." - Ryze
"I never liked surprises." - Ryze
"Dark corners made bright." - Ryze
"I'd like to see them try." - Ryze
"Dark shadows hide dark forces." - Ryze
"A pause in the chaos. Let's make it count." - Ryze
"I'll return stronger. Count on it." - Ryze
"I'm not running away. I'm running at you the long way around." - Ryze
"Hang on, archmage business." - Ryze
"Time to reflect on what we have learned." - Ryze
"A moment to gather our runes." - Ryze
"The scroll... burn it... " - Ryze
"Hide... them... " - Ryze
"They will not... take them... " - Ryze
"Thank the gods, the world's still here." - Ryze
"A stupid mistake, one I won't make again." - Ryze
"I still live, but for how much longer?" - Ryze
"Let's try again, and this time do it right." - Ryze
"Ugh, being dead wastes precious time!" - Ryze
"Blood runs... they all run." - Warwick
"They fear me. They should." - Warwick

"Let's find your spot, love." - Evelynn
"Ooh, you're so hot when you're hurt." - Evelynn
"Sealed with a kiss." - Evelynn
"Come on, let's see those tears." - Evelynn
"Scream! It makes it better." - Evelynn
"Enough foreplay!" - Evelynn
"Let me in!" - Evelynn
"Like what you see? I'll rip off your eyelids!" - Evelynn
"Hurting is yummy." - Evelynn
"We're done when I'm done." - Evelynn
"I can't wait to see your pain face." - Evelynn
"Ohh, yes... Cry for me honey." - Evelynn
"My pleasure, your pain." - Evelynn
"Make me feel..." - Evelynn
"Yes... Yes...!" - Evelynn
"I know you're hurting, but I can't feel without this." - Evelynn
"Everyone's pain tastes different. What flavor is yours?" - Evelynn
"Awww, you thought you were getting lucky!" - Evelynn
"They're just so... stabbable!" - Evelynn
"Your fear is delightful." - Evelynn
"Ooh la la!" - Evelynn
"Hey there." - Evelynn
"Whimper." - Evelynn
"Don't be shy." - Evelynn
"Harder? Okay." - Evelynn
"Careful. I'm a biter." - Evelynn
"I hope this hurts." - Evelynn
"Hello, love." - Evelynn
"Let me see you hurt." - Evelynn
"Beg me to stop." - Evelynn
(mockingly) "No...! Don't...! Stop...!" (Laughs) - Evelynn
"Shut up and scream." - Evelynn
"Wanna get outta here?" - Evelynn
"Love at first sight... And last." - Evelynn
"Don't die wishing you'd had this." - Evelynn
"Hope you like it rough." - Evelynn
"Love me." - Evelynn
"Nothing personal, I just need you to suffer horribly." - Evelynn
"The more I cut away, the closer we'll get." - Evelynn
"That's it...!" - Evelynn
"Not the first time I've had dragon." - Evelynn
"What a magnificent creature... Let's kill it slowly!" - Evelynn
"Don't worry honey, I'm open to all types." - Evelynn
"Cold blooded. Just like me." - Evelynn
"You're a lot to love." - Evelynn
"My... That's a lot of pain." - Evelynn
"The bigger they are, the more places you can hurt them." - Evelynn
"Finally! A man who can satisfy me." - Evelynn
"Hate? No! I hurt them out of love." - Evelynn
"I feel their looks like hot breath. They feel my claws like hot knives." - Evelynn
"Keep them longing, make them plead." - Evelynn
"I only do one night stands." - Evelynn
"Just looking for that special someone to torment." - Evelynn
"I can't feel anything... until they do." - Evelynn
"Every smile is just a frown waiting to be turned upside down." - Evelynn
"The height of their happiness is the depth of their pain." - Evelynn
"This craving will soon be sated." - Evelynn
"Hate and love are just two words for passion." - Evelynn
"I was born of a thousand screams. What's one more?" - Evelynn
"Their mouths say no, but their bodies say "flay me alive."" - Evelynn
"Drink the pain, toss away the rest." - Evelynn
"Once I was overwhelmed by the agony. Now I can't get enough." - Evelynn
"You really don't know someone 'til you've seen them beg for mercy." - Evelynn
"I like the happy ones. They have so much farther to fall." - Evelynn
"Without pain, how would they know pleasure?" - Evelynn
"I hurt them 'til they hurt no more." - Evelynn
"Misery loves whatever I tell it to." - Evelynn
"One touch, with desire... that's all I need." - Evelynn
"Someday they'll love me for who I really am." - Evelynn
"My love cuts to the quick." - Evelynn
"Suffering is the meaning of life. Well... their lives." - Evelynn
"Let's see... something to fill the emptiness..." - Evelynn
"I remember when just a little pain did the trick." - Evelynn
"Rend their flesh, flay them head to toe." - Evelynn
"Girls just wanna tear your throat out with their teeth." - Evelynn
"All my exes are dead." - Evelynn
"Need to find me? Just follow the trail of widows." - Evelynn
"I use every part of their torment. Nothing is wasted." - Evelynn
"I don't break hearts. I just tear them from rib cages." - Evelynn
"They're all my favorites... until they break." - Evelynn
"Through suffering they come to love me. Every. Single. One." - Evelynn
"Human. Agony. My two favorite words." - Evelynn
"These curves are real." - Evelynn
"A man once told me to put on some clothes. So I wore his skin." - Evelynn
"Who does a girl have to kill to start another Rune War?" - Evelynn
"They love to watch me leave." - Evelynn
"Always dress like you're seducing your next victim." - Evelynn
"Ah, how their screams make me tingle." - Evelynn
"Don't try to tell me I'm not gorgeous." - Evelynn
"Every kill is just a lover who didn't work out." - Evelynn
"People have too many emotions. What am I supposed to do with "empathy?"" - Evelynn
"I tasted peace once. Didn't do it for me." - Evelynn
"Let's see... whose life shall I ruin today?" - Evelynn
"The moment they think they have me..." Evelynn laughs. "Yeah, that's what I live for." - Evelynn
"This place is so bland. It needs a splash of red." - Evelynn
"Show me the man who has everything, and I'll show you my next victim." - Evelynn
"Oooh, so many joyful people to hurt." - Evelynn
"I love it when they talk dirty. "No! Please! Stop torturing me!"" Evelynn laughs. - Evelynn
"Know what else is funny? Pulling your tongue out through your neck." - Evelynn
"I've had my eye on you. Now I'm gonna rip yours out." - Evelynn
"First time being tortured? Don't worry, I'll do everything." - Evelynn
"I'll suck every last drop of joy from your heart." - Evelynn
"That skin looks good on you, but it would look better on my bedroom floor." - Evelynn
"Naughty, naughty. That gets you a lashing." - Evelynn
"Pfft, pillow talk." - Evelynn
"I don't really have friends. Just people I haven't eviscerated yet." - Evelynn
"What's the point of torturing you?" - Evelynn
"Ugh. I wouldn't torture you if you were the last person on earth." - Evelynn
"With infinite power comes an infinite capacity for pain." - Evelynn
"I can make you do a lot more than jingle, space man." - Evelynn
"Does that... hurt?" - Evelynn
"So, you're a masochist? Whatcha doing later?" - Evelynn
"Blindfolds, huh? Whatever does it for ya." - Evelynn
"Can your kind even feel? I don't want to waste my time." - Evelynn
"I've seen your wife. You can do better." - Evelynn
"You seem happy. Let's fix that." - Evelynn
"Just the way I like 'em. Big and stupid." - Evelynn
"Why don't we leave the lights on for this?" - Evelynn
"So how are you, River King? I see you haven't missed a meal." - Evelynn
"I like your style, Kench, but stay out of my territory." - Evelynn
"You look like someone I could hurt for days." - Evelynn
"Ooh, I love watching you work." - Evelynn
"How do you kill them so slowly? You have to teach me." - Evelynn
"Have I told you how your parents cried with their final breaths?" - Evelynn
"Don't worry, love. You'll join them soon." - Evelynn
"Love 'em and leave 'em." - Evelynn
"Always leave them wanting more." - Evelynn
"Mind if I slip into something a little more... painful?" - Evelynn
"It's better in the dark." - Evelynn
"Lights out." - Evelynn
"Stalk and seduce." - Evelynn
"The things we whisper in the dark." - Evelynn
"Oooh, I like to watch." - Evelynn
"Let's sneak around." - Evelynn
"They can touch, but they can't look." - Evelynn
"They all look the same in the dark." - Evelynn
"What they don't know won't hurt them... yet." - Evelynn
"Let's play hard to get." - Evelynn
"The night is my veil." - Evelynn
"The things I'm going to do to you." - Evelynn
"That's it, love. Let your guard down." - Evelynn
"Come on, touch me." - Evelynn
"You need to relax." - Evelynn
"Ooh, are you lonely? I can help." - Evelynn
"A little bit of heaven before the hell." - Evelynn
"How 'bout a kiss?" - Evelynn
"Don't go anywhere." - Evelynn
"I'm not done yet." - Evelynn
"Not yet, honey." - Evelynn
"Play more later?" - Evelynn
"Stay right there, love." - Evelynn
"Wait for me, sweetie." - Evelynn
"Aw, playtime's over." - Evelynn
Evelynn makes a noise of disappointment. "I hate it when they don't last." - Evelynn
"It's okay hun, happens to everyone." - Evelynn
"Look at me! I need to watch you go." - Evelynn
"No, no! Don't die yet!" - Evelynn
"Ugh... I think we should break up." - Evelynn
"Oh well... Time to find a new toy." - Evelynn
"Once again, a woman's left unsatisfied." - Evelynn
"That was fast." - Evelynn
"That was hot." - Evelynn
"Ugh, I thought you'd last longer." - Evelynn
"Was it as good for you as it was for me? No? Too bad!" - Evelynn
"Wanna do it again?" - Evelynn
"We need to talk. I want to kill other people." - Evelynn
"I prefer going naked but... Okay." - Evelynn
"It's a sin to cover something so perfect." - Evelynn
"Why not give them something to take off?" - Evelynn
"Hello, hat. Ready to feast on the pain of others?" - Evelynn
"This land will become a sea of torment." - Evelynn
"Even a lich can suffer." - Evelynn
"The pain of a lich is eternal." - Evelynn
"Imagine what we can do with this." - Evelynn
"It's so... big." - Evelynn
"Think of all the places this can go." - Evelynn
"Aahh, still wet with the tears of Liandry herself." - Evelynn
"I do like your style Liandry, whoever you were." - Evelynn
"Now they will all know true pain." - Evelynn
"A girl's gotta know when to disappear." - Evelynn
"Be right back. Gotta put my face on." - Evelynn
"Show's over, boys." - Evelynn
"And by love..." - Evelynn
"I thought we had something el..." - Evelynn
"One last kiss..." - Evelynn
"So this is pain?" - Evelynn
"Guess who's back for more?" - Evelynn
"Okay. My turn." - Evelynn
"So, they like it rough." - Evelynn
"Ugh, dying is such a turn-off." - Evelynn

"A man, a woman and a yordle walk into the sun. They die! Because it burns them alive? Heh heh heh heh." - Diana
"Knock, knock. Who's there? The moon... it's far away! You were alone the whole time! Ha ha ha!" - Diana
"They called me a heretic, now they are dead." - Diana
"The moon will rise. The night will last forever." - Diana
"Nightfall!" - Diana
"Dusk!" - Diana
"Twilight fades!" - Diana
"Night approaches." - Diana
"Naturally." - Aurelion Sol
"Hmph. Tragic." - Aurelion Sol
"They call me a comet. They call me a dragon. They have no words for my true form." - Aurelion Sol
"Cower, worship, beg, they're all valid reactions." - Aurelion Sol
"In a constantly shifting cosmos, a world this static is... refreshing." - Aurelion Sol
"There simply are no other dragons like me." - Aurelion Sol
"The stars look very different today." - Aurelion Sol
"Hope. Wonder. Insignificance. Imagine what they'll feel when I complete the stars." - Aurelion Sol
"Now we're playing with star fire!" - Aurelion Sol
"My, how they stare." - Aurelion Sol
"Let's end this on a high note!" - Aurelion Sol
"None shall tread upon the stars." - Aurelion Sol
"Never stand in the path of a star." - Aurelion Sol
"Time to give them a show." - Aurelion Sol
"It's beyond too late to seek cover." - Aurelion Sol
"You will know your place." - Aurelion Sol
"Impending doom - exciting, isn't it?" - Aurelion Sol
"Congratulations, you have earned my contempt." - Aurelion Sol
"Lighten up, destruction needn't be a maudlin affair." - Aurelion Sol
"Suns never burn for the benefit of dust." - Aurelion Sol
"Useless and intolerable. Charming." - Aurelion Sol
"Plenty more to come." - Aurelion Sol
"Defending yourself? Adorably futile." - Aurelion Sol
"Tedious being." - Aurelion Sol
"Boring me is dangerous." - Aurelion Sol
"I never bite. Too uncouth." - Aurelion Sol
"I'm going to throw a star at you now. Good luck." - Aurelion Sol
"You are more useful as dust." - Aurelion Sol
"Too bad." - Aurelion Sol
"I tried to like you." - Aurelion Sol
"Nothing a little star fire cannot fix." - Aurelion Sol
"Be useful. Be stardust. I'll help." - Aurelion Sol
"Why would I spare such mediocrity?" - Aurelion Sol
"You are woefully underprepared." - Aurelion Sol
"Bravery is absurd - but admirable." - Aurelion Sol
"Live through this, and we'll chat." - Aurelion Sol
"I'll indulge your foolhardy nature." - Aurelion Sol
"Admire... then die." - Aurelion Sol
"Oh, you will shine." - Aurelion Sol
"Defenses? Laughable." - Aurelion Sol
"Be brighter. I'll help." - Aurelion Sol
"Think cosmic - like this!" - Aurelion Sol
"Not everyone shines brightly enough!" - Aurelion Sol
"Irritating cluster of particles." - Aurelion Sol
"To atoms!" - Aurelion Sol
"Return to dust." - Aurelion Sol
"Smoulder, then implode!" - Aurelion Sol
"They are merely dust." - Aurelion Sol
"Illuminate." - Aurelion Sol
"Melt." - Aurelion Sol
"What a pity." - Aurelion Sol
"Dragon's breath it is." - Aurelion Sol
"Good find." - Aurelion Sol
"Terrestrial dragons - a study of flawed constitutions." - Aurelion Sol
"Low dragon, unfitting of the name." - Aurelion Sol
"You call yourself a dragon? You're low-flame at best." - Aurelion Sol
"A dragon that still needs wings to fly? Keep trying, you'll get there." - Aurelion Sol
"I did mean to call you back, but stars needed forging." - Aurelion Sol
"This world holds the key to Targon's undoing." - Aurelion Sol
"Targon has used me as its weapon for far too long." - Aurelion Sol
"The heavens diminish without my attention." - Aurelion Sol
"I would burn the cosmos to catch Targon in the flames." - Aurelion Sol
"The depths of space crawl with terrible entities. Pray they ignore this world." - Aurelion Sol
"There are countless colors, but I suppose a single rainbow was a good start." - Aurelion Sol
"This sun is off its axis - it's been driving me crazy for eons now." - Aurelion Sol
"Planetary life... the insufferable byproduct of dim stars." - Aurelion Sol
"Targon's magic is crude, but potent." - Aurelion Sol
"Nothing kindles wonder like the beauty of stars." - Aurelion Sol
"Celestial dragons live and die by our own beautiful rules." - Aurelion Sol
"Love is as real a force as gravity. Try it once in a while." - Aurelion Sol
"Stars are not born, they are made... by me." - Aurelion Sol
"A star's birth is as violent as it is breathtaking." - Aurelion Sol
"I've waited millennia to watch Targon fall." - Aurelion Sol
"All beings are made of the same stardust." - Aurelion Sol
"With a few more basic elements I could really make this place shimmer." - Aurelion Sol
"The stars are not to thank for any good luck one may experience." - Aurelion Sol
"This sun could do with a new core." - Aurelion Sol
"Any relevant species has been knocked back into the Stone Age once or twice." - Aurelion Sol
"I wouldn't navigate by the stars. They are a work in progress." - Aurelion Sol
"Each star is one of my hearts." - Aurelion Sol
"My works are revered by worlds I have never even visited." - Aurelion Sol
"Wherever I am is the fashionable part of the universe. Even here." - Aurelion Sol
"Stars are wonder and love ignited." - Aurelion Sol
"I spark passion into star fire." - Aurelion Sol
"A star is so much more than a luminous sphere of wonder." - Aurelion Sol
"If you ask me, we have set the bar too low for sentience." - Aurelion Sol
"My home is in the cosmos, amongst my stars." - Aurelion Sol
"The stories they tell about me? They're probably true." - Aurelion Sol
"All terrestrial dragons are but pale imitations of my kind." - Aurelion Sol
"Perhaps there is more to this world than I thought - not much, but enough." - Aurelion Sol
"As Targon's influence wanes, mine grows." - Aurelion Sol
"Why does anyone wish upon a star?" - Aurelion Sol
"Stars never align for anyone - except me, of course." - Aurelion Sol
"Sometimes, the stars gaze back." - Aurelion Sol
"I kindled the furnaces of wonder." - Aurelion Sol
"Only when darkness overwhelms the heavens will Targon realise its folly." - Aurelion Sol
"My stars shine for all." - Aurelion Sol
"Targon will be the pyre from which I forge a new heaven." - Aurelion Sol
"I see a universe drained of light and heat, where not even a story will survive." - Aurelion Sol
"I grieve for every star never born." - Aurelion Sol
"Darkness is my only true enemy." - Aurelion Sol
"Whenever I think my work is complete, I end up back here, under this sun." - Aurelion Sol
"May I enter? Just joking - star dragons don't need permission." - Aurelion Sol
"Your demise will be sung about for ages to come - only thanks to its proximity to me, of course." - Aurelion Sol
"Your survival is not impossible, only very... very... very unlikely." - Aurelion Sol
"I shall be the last thing you see. Lucky you." - Aurelion Sol
"Make a wish. See if the stars answer. I'll wait." - Aurelion Sol
"What is the definition of underwhelming? Oh, right! You." - Aurelion Sol
"I used to wander the stars. Now I'm stuck down here, with you." - Aurelion Sol
"On other worlds, there is emerging life more complex than you." - Aurelion Sol
"You aspire to be human? Oh, darling, there are so many other variants on mediocrity!" - Aurelion Sol
"I am... overwhelmed by an emotion when you are not around. It is called... happiness." - Aurelion Sol
"Mages are infants grasping at the machinery behind reality. At least you have a plausible excuse." - Aurelion Sol
"You Ascended certainly know how to pick an animal totem." - Aurelion Sol
"Your immortality is but a grain of sand in time's vast desert." - Aurelion Sol
"Pick a dimension, Bard, you're confusing them!" - Aurelion Sol
"Were you born this flat, or did you work at it?" - Aurelion Sol
"The funnier the hat, the greater the prestige, right?" - Aurelion Sol
"Runeterra. Am I right?" - Aurelion Sol
"You and Leona embody the same light. Typical Targon redundancy." - Aurelion Sol
"It is always a moon's role to envy the stars." - Aurelion Sol
"You're out of your league." - Aurelion Sol
"Oh, come on, have a little self-respect!" - Aurelion Sol
"You would make an interesting dragon." - Aurelion Sol
"If dunking is the apex of this primitive sport, then I am the queen of space." - Aurelion Sol
"Made a mistake? Better rewind and repeat until you achieve mediocrity." - Aurelion Sol
"Fear? Generic." - Aurelion Sol
"Idealism? Hilariously outdated." - Aurelion Sol
"Rage? Cute." - Aurelion Sol
"Gunpowder and metal sticks. Enchanting." - Aurelion Sol
"Ah, mankind. Ever fumbling from one brink of cataclysm to the next." - Aurelion Sol
"Humanity, surprisingly adept in the art of wrestling survival from the clutches of extinction." - Aurelion Sol
"As far as fauna goes, humans strike a firm... middle." - Aurelion Sol
"I've seen the main act. You're only a third-rate cover band." - Aurelion Sol
"You do not understand your god, Illaoi." - Aurelion Sol
"Imagine what you could do with a larger canvas." - Aurelion Sol
"Life is short, go crazy once in a while, I get it." - Aurelion Sol
"The sun? This sun? Oh, darling." - Aurelion Sol
"You and Diana embody the same light. Typical Targon redundancy." - Aurelion Sol
"All dazzle, no brilliance." - Aurelion Sol
"There is a saying on this planet - "Dumb as a rock". It's not a compliment." - Aurelion Sol
"You are going to kill me? Dressed like that?" - Aurelion Sol
"Bravo, Nasus, you've ascended yourself into a dog! Now fetch me something more interesting." - Aurelion Sol
"I could teach an old dog millions of new tricks, but I simply don't like you, Nasus." - Aurelion Sol
"Your fate was sealed the moment you picked up Targon's spear." - Aurelion Sol
"Are you burdened by your own monotony? Because I am." - Aurelion Sol
"That whole practice of Ascension is adorably amusing, like a kitten trying to walk upright." - Aurelion Sol
"Ah, Ryze, I see you've brought paper to take notes." - Aurelion Sol
"True magic is beyond language. Writing merely butchers the intent." - Aurelion Sol
"Magic tattoos? Where did you get those, magic prison?... oh." - Aurelion Sol
"Almost interesting. Almost." - Aurelion Sol
"A dragon's loyalty is a priceless gift. Do not waste it in the service of fools." - Aurelion Sol
"Medium flame, and that is me being generous." - Aurelion Sol
"Unfitting of the draconic lineage." - Aurelion Sol
"Twinkle, twinkle, little star, do you wonder what you are?" - Aurelion Sol
"The heavens drag on endlessly... much like a conversation with you." - Aurelion Sol
"The Aspect of Targon? Sparks masquerading as lightning." - Aurelion Sol
"I will cauterize Targon with star fire." - Aurelion Sol
"You're an Aspect? Let me guess - tackiness." - Aurelion Sol
"Galaxies exist by my will - but, yes, that is certainly an impressive sword." - Aurelion Sol
"Hm. Punching?" - Aurelion Sol
"You are going to punch a star dragon. Good luck with that." - Aurelion Sol
"Blood magic? How tragically primitive." - Aurelion Sol
"I empathize with your life as a weapon, but have a little backbone." - Aurelion Sol
"You bend time the way a child folds origami - cute, but nothing special." - Aurelion Sol
"Few can impress me. That is a compliment." - Aurelion Sol
"Which star is your favorite? I made that one." - Aurelion Sol
"I made the stars... but you inspire me to make more." - Aurelion Sol
"First you start with some matter, then add star fire and voila! It basically does the rest itself." - Aurelion Sol
"Runeterra? I mean the name of this world literally means 'magic earth'." - Aurelion Sol
"I made the stars to illuminate the perpetual nothing, and mortals use them for... relationship advice." - Aurelion Sol
"A sun is unimaginable celestial power - and thrilled mortals use theirs to coordinate this 'lunch time'." - Aurelion Sol
"I make entropy look good." - Aurelion Sol
"Of course I love Runeterra! You have buildings and... more buildings." - Aurelion Sol
"Hello, Runeterra! Are you ready to rock?" - Aurelion Sol
"Let's dance!" - Rakan
"Join me in the dance cosmic!" - Aurelion Sol
"Boop." - Aurelion Sol
"Starstruck?" - Aurelion Sol
"Wrong orbit. Wrong time." - Aurelion Sol
"The stars weep for you. Just kidding - I already forgot your name." - Aurelion Sol
"My wish upon a star came true." - Aurelion Sol
"Nice job, just standing there." - Aurelion Sol
"Stars are best viewed from a distance." - Aurelion Sol
"The stars were not in their favor." - Aurelion Sol
"I guess their fate was written in the stars." - Aurelion Sol
"Accrete!" - Aurelion Sol
"Pure star fire!" - Aurelion Sol
"Time to gather the necessary matter!" - Aurelion Sol
"Feels good to make things again!" - Aurelion Sol
"Aim... and ignite!" - Aurelion Sol
"Anyone want some stardust?" - Aurelion Sol
"A little dim - but it still works." - Aurelion Sol
"Beautiful - such a shame." - Aurelion Sol
"This will be quite the deadly spectacle." - Aurelion Sol
"And I'm barely trying!" - Aurelion Sol
"Expanding my horizons." - Aurelion Sol
"Stellar!" - Aurelion Sol
"Time for a great expansion." - Aurelion Sol
"My sphere of influence grows." - Aurelion Sol
"Put it on my tab. The name's Pantheon, with a P." - Aurelion Sol
"Put it on Mount Targon's tab." - Aurelion Sol
"Pay? Do you know who I am?" - Aurelion Sol
"Just... my... style." - Aurelion Sol
"Fine, take your gold." - Aurelion Sol
"Money? How barbaric." - Aurelion Sol
"I tend to burn through footwear." - Aurelion Sol
"My feet rarely touch the ground." - Aurelion Sol
"Some things are simply better with age." - Aurelion Sol
"Ages? This thing has been around for centuries, tops." - Aurelion Sol
"It's been around for ages? So... almost new." - Aurelion Sol
"All things appreciate in value over time." - Aurelion Sol
"Hats are always fashionable." - Aurelion Sol
"As long as it's set at a jaunty angle I'm in." - Aurelion Sol
"A snow globe? Perfect for my collect - to destroy you. Destroy you!" - Aurelion Sol
"Shiny - but it's no star." - Aurelion Sol
"Time to slow things down a bit." - Aurelion Sol
"A bit gaudy for my tastes but exceedingly useful." - Aurelion Sol
"Liandry's Torment - my benefit." - Aurelion Sol
"Perfect for the bimillenial celestial masquerade ball." - Aurelion Sol
"If Bard and Kindred can pull off wearing a mask, so can I." - Aurelion Sol
"There are no echoes where I'm from." - Aurelion Sol
"But a shadow of sound." - Aurelion Sol
"So many magics staves." - Aurelion Sol
"All towers fall - it's just what they do when I'm around." - Aurelion Sol
"Nothing they build can endure like the celestial firmament." - Aurelion Sol
"Towers tend to crumble when I am in the vicinity." - Aurelion Sol
"Topple, like all things crafted by mortals." - Aurelion Sol
"The architects of these towers misunderstand object permanence." - Aurelion Sol
"How many must I knock down before they learn?" - Aurelion Sol
"You may look forward to more of this." - Aurelion Sol
"Never stop when you're on a roll." - Aurelion Sol
"I shall inscribe this moment in the stars." - Aurelion Sol
"That ought to keep them talking for the next century or so." - Aurelion Sol
"Cosmic dragon; five. Everyone else; zero. Please, take notes." - Aurelion Sol
"Well, that was easy." - Aurelion Sol
"Another mass extinction. So soon?" - Aurelion Sol
"Always leave them begging for more." - Aurelion Sol
"Don't miss me too much." - Aurelion Sol
"I've seen enough." - Aurelion Sol
"Always know when to make an entrance - and an exit." - Aurelion Sol
"Alas, I am simply too beautiful for this world." - Aurelion Sol
"Never said I was infallible." - Aurelion Sol
"Left an exquisite corpse." - Aurelion Sol
"The brightest stars shine on long after they're gone." - Aurelion Sol
"Darling, you have but set my hearts free." - Aurelion Sol
"With a lifespan as comically brief as yours, I suppose I can allow you to taste triumph at least once." - Aurelion Sol
"Ah, the joys of lesser organisms rising up to slay their betters! If only they were aware of the impermanence of being... or the permanence of me." - Aurelion Sol
"Stars never fall." - Aurelion Sol
"Because I am a star dragon. That's why." - Aurelion Sol
"It's not a comeback if one was never truly gone." - Aurelion Sol
"Hello again. Let's have some fun." - Aurelion Sol
"Energy never dies." - Aurelion Sol
Kayn: "Will you prove worthy?"	 Rhaast: "Probably not." - Kayn

Kayn: "You have my undivided attention!" - Kayn
Rhaast: "Set me free!" - Kayn
Rhaast: "Drive me into their flesh!" - Kayn
Rhaast: "Kill them all!" - Kayn

Rhaast: "Every slaughter has humble beginnings." - Kayn
Rhaast: "Never underestimate hatred." - Kayn
Rhaast: "Feed me more lives!" - Kayn
Kayn: "He's with you I assume?"	 Rhaast: "Aatrox ... we have ... history..." - Kayn
Rhaast: "This is your master? Zed?"	 Kayn: "Leave us to it!" - Kayn
Rhaast: "Teacher and student... yes?"	 Kayn: "Inevitable." - Kayn
Kayn: "This brings me no pleasure, Shen."	 Rhaast: "It will for me." - Kayn
Kayn: "The bigger they are..."	 Rhaast: "The louder they scream." - Kayn
Kayn: "Such a waste of time." - Kayn
Kayn: "This will only dull the blade." - Kayn
Rhaast: "Sure, why not." - Kayn
Rhaast: "Well... we are here..." - Kayn
Rhaast: "There is much darkness around you, in you."	 Kayn: "That is my armor." - Kayn
Kayn: "I let you go and you will die."	 "Rhaast: And you will lose." - Kayn
Rhaast: "Tell me, was it desperation that led you to me?"	 Kayn: "Audacity." - Kayn
Kayn: "I am the weapon, you are a tool."	 Rhaast: "Lies sooth the mind, don't they?" - Kayn
Rhaast: "I see your nightmares, do they trouble you?"	 Kayn: "Not nightmares, plans..." - Kayn
Rhaast: "I have waited eons to bathe this realm in blood!"	 Kayn: "Talk, talk... You'll do nothing without me." - Kayn
Rhaast: "Ionians, are they all as confident as you?"	 Kayn: "There is no one like me." - Kayn
Kayn: "What will be the final lesson?"	 Rhaast: "Give in, and I will show you." - Kayn
Kayn: "I was born into a nation of despair and I alone am the remedy." - Kayn
Kayn: "I have chosen you, you will serve me." - Kayn
Kayn: "I have mastered every weapon of war, no prattling tool will prove an exception." - Kayn
Kayn: "Who should I obey? Master Zed or the farm implement with delusions of grandure?" - Kayn
Kayn: "Underestimate me at your peril." - Kayn
Rhaast: "The rage is in your hands, let it loose!" - Kayn
Rhaast: "Their screams thrill me." - Kayn
Rhaast: "Zed's order shackles you, I offer freedom!" - Kayn
Rhaast: "You are not worthy of the power you hold." - Kayn
Rhaast: "This is the part I like best, the anticipation. No, it's the killing." - Kayn
Rhaast: "Such an obsequious pupil, I will be your new master." - Kayn
Rhaast: "Target the strong, I am a weapon not some accessory." - Kayn
Rhaast: "Neither time nor violence will end me." - Kayn
Kayn: "What does Rhaast mean anyway?"	 Rhaast: "Obey." - Kayn
Kayn: "Kill the body." - Kayn
Kayn: "Kill the mind." - Kayn
Kayn: "I learned from a young age to embrace the shadows."	 Rhaast: "Darkness is a start." - Kayn
Rhaast: "I am no toy Kayn."	 Kayn: "You possess the hubris of a more fearsome weapon." - Kayn
Kayn: "(Laughs) Their screams will echo in this place" - Kayn
Rhaast: "Stain this fetid swamp with their blood." - Kayn
Rhaast: "Oh how I miss the smell of blood in the water"	 Kayn: "Today you will be reminded." - Kayn
Kayn: "Wait by the river long enough and the enemy dead will float by" - Kayn
Rhaast: "Oh yeah... Let's turn this river red." - Kayn
Kayn: "The blood of the fallen will annoint me the new master."	Rhaast:"Everyone does look better in red." - Kayn
Rhaast: "Rage inside me will not be contained!"	Kayn: "The spade does not dictate the architect's vision." - Kayn
Kayn: "Lives will be taken, and the real plan revealed"	Rhaast: "Killing is the plan, let me show you." - Kayn
Kayn: "The true assassin kills one to save many."	Rhaast: "Such noble lies, save no one; It's so liberating!" - Kayn
Rhaast: "I will survive eternity, they will die today." - Kayn
Rhaast: "Cast off the yoke of Zed's order."	Kayn: "It is the order that will break you, Rhaast." - Kayn
Rhaast: "There is fear in your grip and doubt in your heart."	Kayn: "I have no heart, that you should fear." - Kayn
Rhaast: "The undoing draws near."	Kayn: "Yes, yours." - Kayn
Rhaast:"Every kill fuels my fury." - Kayn
Rhaast:"Yes! Slaughter!" - Kayn
Rhaast:"Just like that and the world will be yours to destroy." - Kayn
Rhaast:"Tenacity versus fury... Fury always wins." - Kayn
Rhaast:"Why murder one, when you can slaughter many?" - Kayn
Rhaast:"Triumph is built on a foundation of death." - Kayn
Rhaast:"The strong fall so quickly to my blade." - Kayn
Rhaast:"The only way to kill..." - Kayn
Rhaast:"These are the strong? Pathetic." - Kayn
Rhaast:"Worthless foes mock my presence." - Kayn
Rhaast:"Those who seek balance find only death." - Kayn
Rhaast:"Balance is weakness." - Kayn
Rhaast:"This is but a taste of my wrath." - Kayn
Kayn: "With each kill, the shadows grow deeper." - Kayn
Kayn: "Death delivered with precision is true power." - Kayn
Kayn: "What was written in shadow, now in flesh." - Kayn
Kayn: "Death finds fools quickly." - Kayn
Kayn: "Cowards hide! But never escape." - Kayn
Kayn: "Fear is your shadow! You are cloaked in it." - Kayn
Kayn: "The shadows are my realm and your grave." - Kayn
Kayn: "Shadows are a shallow grave." - Kayn
Kayn: "Facing me was a mistake." - Kayn
Kayn: "That was your destiny... To die." - Kayn
Kayn: "Those seeking balance, will find death." - Kayn
Kayn: "Even Zed would be impressed." - Kayn
Rhaast: "Sorry brother, you were in my way." - Kayn
Rhaast: "Your skills have not improved, Aatrox." - Kayn
Rhaast: "Zed is dead baby, Zed is dead." - Kayn
Kayn: "It should not have come to this, Zed." - Kayn
Kayn: "You taught me too well master." - Kayn
Kayn: "Live by the shadow, die by the shadow." - Kayn
Rhaast: "Zed's final lesson? Don't be him." - Kayn
Kayn: "Shen, consider this a debt paid to a friend" - Kayn
Rhaast: "Demon pants had it coming." - Kayn
Kayn: "Noxian strength is a lie." - Kayn
Kayn: "No mercy! Right, Noxian?" - Kayn

Kayn: "For those who can not see in the dark." - Kayn
Kayn: "Let there be sight." - Kayn

"One stone at a time." - Taliyah
"I meant to do that - mostly." - Taliyah
"Even rocks can be unpredictable." - Taliyah
"A rock in my hand is worth two in your face!" - Taliyah
"Beware falling rocks!" - Taliyah
"How did I do that?" - Taliyah
"That looks like it hurt!" - Taliyah
"Either way, I'm going to learn something from this." - Taliyah

(Enemy) "Huh. I guess that's funny where you come from." - Taliyah
"Problems should be broken up into little pieces." - Taliyah
"Take this!" - Taliyah
"Tag, you're it!" - Taliyah
"If at first you don't succeed, throw another rock!" - Taliyah
"I told you to stand back!" - Taliyah
"You've strayed too far!" - Taliyah
"Up you go!" - Taliyah

"Ah, new beginnings." - Braum
"Let's get going." - Braum

"Hm. It is windy today." - Braum
"Eat, eat and grow strong." - Braum
"Train hard, little poro, and one day you will be strong like... baby!" - Braum

"And now, the curtain rises." - Jhin
Jhin hums. - Jhin
"You will be poetry." - Jhin

"Beauty is pain." - Jhin
"I will make you famous." - Jhin

"Places, please!" - Jhin
"Delightful!" - Jhin
"Alright!" - Xayah

"Sublime." - Jhin
"Transcendent." - Jhin
"Divine." - Jhin
"Darling." - Jhin
"Precious." - Jhin
"Symmetry is so boring." - Jhin
"I've outdone myself this time." - Jhin

"I will touch your heart." - Jhin
"They're gonna live, until they die." - Jhin
"This is my calling." - Jhin
"Places everyone, places!" - Jhin
"Shall we dance?" - Jhin
"Sing for me!" - Jhin
"I rehearsed this!" - Jhin
"There is no drama in a peaceful death!" - Jhin
"Dance for me." - Jhin
"Right. On. Cue." - Jhin
"Inspired." - Jhin
"The show never ends!" - Jhin
"How lovely!" - Jhin
"Center stage!" - Jhin
"I couldn't miss your performance." - Jhin
"The work is what matters." - Jhin
"Art requires a certain cruelty." - Jhin
"The end is important in all things." - Jhin
"My audience awaits." - Jhin
"I must wait until a composition is perfect." - Jhin
"They're puppets. I pull their strings, and then they dance." - Jhin
"My genius will be understood - eventually." - Jhin
"Art must exist beyond reason." - Jhin
"They call me mad. All artists are mad." - Jhin
"I will not suffer this ugliness." - Jhin
"I cannot be good. I must be perfection." - Jhin
"Every element must be in place." - Jhin
"I'm misunderstood. Beauty can't be evil." - Jhin
"This performance needs more... zazz." - Jhin
"It's so difficult to work under these conditions." - Jhin
"My talent justifies all actions." - Jhin
"I am at my best only during the performance." - Jhin
"I am pure. My work is pure." - Jhin
"My theater is the mind." - Jhin
"Art should terrify." - Jhin
"No poet's words could match my craft." - Jhin
"Death should never be quick. It should be an opera." - Jhin
"I shall choreograph this affair." - Jhin
"What sweet sadness is killing?" - Jhin
"The world is cruel. It does not have to be ugly." - Jhin
"Everyone wears a mask. I just chose to create my own." - Jhin
"This art is a compulsion. I cannot resist it." - Jhin
"Perfection isn't good enough." - Jhin
"Behind every mask... is another mask." - Jhin
"There is nothing for me but this." - Jhin
"I never hurt anyone. It is the performance that kills." - Jhin
"Until they stop me, I will keep going." - Jhin
"I am the singer without a voice. The dancer without legs." - Jhin
"Only to the audience do I show my true face." - Jhin
"Each bullet is a piece of my soul. Each shot is a piece of me." - Jhin
"I swear each performance is the last, but I lie every time." - Jhin
"I am a slave to this passion." - Jhin
"My work asks questions, it never has answers." - Jhin
"Which is the lie? The mask, or my face?" - Jhin
"An icon doesn't have to explain himself." - Jhin
"I wonder what they think when they see me." - Jhin
"Yes, the gun is ironic." - Jhin
"I like a violent composition." - Jhin
"This would be easier if blood came in more colours." - Jhin
"Let's start the show." - Jhin
"The ecstasy of opening night." - Jhin
"Smiles and screams, I bring both." - Jhin
"If I keep getting interrupted, how can I be expected to work?" - Jhin
"I was paid to put on a killer show." - Jhin
"My clients expect the best." - Jhin
"They will dance, they will sing, they will die!" - Jhin
"A costume, some makeup, a spray of blood." - Jhin
"It's very simple - when I shoot, they dance." - Jhin
"My critics are... usually short-lived." - Jhin
"If I get this outfit dirty, I'm going to be so annoyed." - Jhin
"I serve a discerning clientele." - Jhin
"Death is certain, but killing doesn't have to be ugly." - Jhin
"I provide catharsis for my clients, and my victims." - Jhin
"I... orchestrate death." - Jhin
"I get nervous before every performance, but I need that feeling." - Jhin
"The moment before the shot... is painful." - Jhin
"It is only when the gun fires that I am alive." - Jhin
"Mmm... the ecstasy of killing." - Jhin
"The trigger on a loaded weapon... it whispers for us to act." - Jhin
"I can't live without the euphoria of performance." - Jhin
"Happiness... is a warm gun." - Jhin
"I want to feel everything. The gun makes it so I do." - Jhin
"I envy silence... because I must be loud." - Jhin
"You lack imagination." - Jhin
"I have elaborate plans for you." - Jhin
"Killing you will be one of my finest works." - Jhin
"You are mediocrity. My genius will supplant you." - Jhin
"Only my actions will make you memorable." - Jhin
"It hurts so good..." - Jhin
"You only understand harmony. Discord is required for contrast." - Jhin
"My dear countryman, you remind me how little our culture has advanced." - Jhin
"I am avant-garde - you are stuck in the past." - Jhin
"The Noxian invasion should be a wake-up call. We need more elaborate productions." - Jhin
"I do what others will not. That alone is innovation." - Jhin
"I remember your father! He thought he could censor me." - Jhin
"I have been planning your final performance for a very... long... time." - Jhin
"You helped lock me away. You tried to stop my work. My art cannot be contained." - Jhin
"Your father was a merciful man. Only his failure will be remembered." - Jhin
"Your father's death denied me a performance. You will be his stand-in." - Jhin
"You wanted to kill me back then, didn't you? You will learn - art cannot be killed." - Jhin
"You think you can stop my performance?" - Jhin
"An understudy can't upstage me." - Jhin
"I remember your master. He was worth remembering." - Jhin
"You were wrong to kill your master. I needed him for this performance." - Jhin

"Oh, I knew you was all yeller!" - Kled
"Them's humans!"	 Skaarl growls	   "Naw, they're good eatin'." - Kled
"What was that? Oh, I should go for the decakill? Uh, if you say so." - Kled
"It's my property! All sixty gazillion acres of it!" - Kled
"Holy $%!#, where are we?"	 Skaarl growls	   "Guess we'll have to kill our way out!" - Kled
"Slow down so I can kill something!" - Kled
"Get off my lawn!" - Kled
"They's about to be dead!" - Kled
"This land is my land!" - Kled
"Damn trespassers!" - Kled
"Step on my land again, you're done!" - Kled
"How about a long axe in your guts?" - Kled
"You are perturbing my tranquility!" - Kled
"You should run! Skaarl likes his food lively!" - Kled
"Don't interrupt me! I'm trying to start a fight!" - Kled
"Damn city folk!" - Kled
"I'm Kled, and this here's Skaarl. Prepare to die." - Kled
"This is how it's gonna work: I kill you, then I take your stuff." - Kled
"Look, Skaarl! It's dinner time!" - Kled
"You see my welcome sign back there? No? It was your friend's skull!" - Kled
"You will salute when you address me!" - Kled
"Let's get them trespassers!" - Kled
"Why ain't they saluting me? They should be saluting me! Salute me now!" - Kled
"You get my invitation to visit? No? 'cause there ain't one!" - Kled
"Let's do it!" - Kled
"Oh, it's on!" - Kled
"I got your welcoming present right here!" - Kled
"The badgers command your death!" - Kled
"Only coffin's gonna' be this lizard's belly!" - Kled
"Let's get 'em, Skaarl!" - Kled
"I might have to jump off this lizard and put my boot in your watoosie!" - Kled

"You can't bushwhack a bushwhacker!" - Kled

"Stab!" - Kled
"Axe!" - Kled
"This land was made for me - and me alone." - Kled
"I hate to advocate violence and insanity, but it's worked for me." - Kled
"Were you just talking, or was it the voices again?" - Kled
"I do not want my lands tamed. I want them unruly and free." - Kled
"I'm from all over. It's next to nowhere and shut the hell up!" - Kled
"I play with guns. I work with an axe." - Kled
"Mushrooms are healthy! Once you get used to the madness and paranoia." - Kled
"A man without a weapon ain't worth listening to." - Kled
"Yeah, I like it out here. Freedom, communing with nature, killing hikers." - Kled
"They ain't ready for us." - Kled
"I keep hallucinating that you can talk."	 Skaarl growls	   "Nah, I'm sure it'll pass." - Kled
"Skaarl! This ain't no time for philosophying!" - Kled
"Killing a few things might loosen this up." - Kled
"No more of that! You're upsetting the invisible badgers!" - Kled
"My land begins where I walk. It ends where the sun don't shine!" - Kled
"Damn cowards, making me ride over to kill 'em." - Kled
"Well, maybe I am looking to start a fight!" - Kled
"I do prefer to ride into battle." - Kled
"Yeah, but... then how we gonna' invade both bases at once?" - Kled
"No, I'm positive, I ain't delusional!" Kled mumbles. - Kled
"Of course I'm paranoid! You tried to kill me yesterday!" - Kled
"Nah, them we kill them too! Ain't nobody on my team but you." - Kled
"I came to cut off a piece of that Noxian dream... and I ain't sharing my piece!" - Kled
"Don't try and understand 'em, just rope, throw and brand 'em." - Kled
"I grew up mean and now I'm older than murder." - Kled
"Ain't nothing more beautiful than the Noxian plains... excepting a rich corpse." - Kled
"All we need is open country, but we gonna' take everything they got!" - Kled
"I fight better when I've had my... medicine." - Kled
"No! Planning and strategy? That's city-folk stuff!" - Kled
"Don't need a plan... long as I got this axe." - Kled
"Yeah, they just confirming our suspicions, ain't they?" - Kled
"I don't have trouble communicating. Words is just treacherous bastards." - Kled
"You ready, Skaarl? This day's gonna' require some mindblowing weirdness." - Kled
"Are you ready for anything?"	 Skaarl growls	   "Of course you are!" - Kled
"Hey, it's Forward Admiral Major Kled! I ain't been a Mister since ever!" - Kled
"Shh! Them brain weasels probably listening for us." - Kled
"Let's get to killing them interloping intruders!" - Kled
"Was the battle of Falgrim when I first took the rank of Sergeant General Colonel. Least, I think that's what rank they was. Gotta' remember to ask before killing them." - Kled
"Ain't nothing like having the wind on your back and blood on your face." - Kled
"It's your birthday, Skaarl! Let's bake a murder cake!" - Kled
"Well, my foot wanted to meet your ass, and I'm about to give them a shotgun wedding!" - Kled
"Shh! It's time to get violent... and weird." - Kled
"Oh, we find 'em, tie 'em up, then they's like a piata full of meat." - Kled
"Damnit Skaarl, d'you hide my mushroom juice again?" - Kled
"After we finish murdering these folks, what do you think? Tacos? Yeah, tacos." - Kled
"First, we kill 'em, then we make 'em tell us where they came from." - Kled
"Remember when we sacked Trevail, and that general thought we'd be willing to share the spoils? Pheh! Officers die just as easy as anybody." - Kled
"There ain't no land that ain't mine. Just land I ain't got around to claiming." - Kled
"Just 'cause they're our team don't mean we can trust 'em." - Kled
"They're all trespassers, we're just killing them five first." - Kled
"Yeah, yeah, invade Ionia you said, it'll be fine you said!"	 Skaarl growls	   "Fine, you said!" - Kled
"Yeah, reminds me of the siege of Rugg. Lot of men died on its high walls. It was fun." - Kled
"At the gates of Qualthala, they tried using that boiling oil on us, but you can't deep-fry courage!" - Kled
"I know, I know." - Kled
"Would you stop bitching for one minute?" - Kled
"I am deep-fried courage, and an apple pie of angry!" - Kled
"Because I know someone is trying to sneak up on us!" - Kled
"Yeah, they think they so clever! Brains don't win fights, brains is what splatter on you!" - Kled
"Well, you the only thing I trust." - Kled
"Yeah, well, that's what I thought." - Kled
"Shut your hole, you dumb lizard." - Kled
"Well, just 'cause you're a hallucination and I don't speak lizard don't mean I can't understand you!" - Kled
"You do come up with the best ideas." - Kled
"No, it's when I don't drink mushroom juice that I have a problem!" - Kled
"I am Kled! High Major Commodore of the First Legion Third Multiplication Double Admiral Artillery Vanguard Company! You will respect my authority!" - Kled
"We was having a nice conversation, then they showed up... uninvited!" - Kled
"Noxus was created to train the faithful." - Kled
"What are you whining about? I already fed you half a platoon!" - Kled
"Don't you bite me again!" - Kled
"Naw, it's just like the assault on Glorft. You seen one artillery vanguard in a commando fleet action, you seen 'em all." - Kled
"Noxus ends where I say it ends." - Kled
"Ain't much I love. Only this big sky, and this dumb lizard." - Kled
"Let's get some new property." - Kled
"The sky is my roof, the open plains are my bed, and this lizard is the only company I need." - Kled
"This big sky, this green land. Now how could I share this with anyone?" - Kled
"Woo, it's darn pretty round here. Glad it's mine." - Kled
"You can't be lonely when the land is this beautiful." - Kled
"This world is rough. You gotta' be tough or die." - Kled
"Yes, a sane man would run, but I ain't the running kind!" - Kled
"No-one tells me what to do." - Kled
"This here land is mine!" - Kled
"This is just a victory waiting to happen!" - Kled
"This desert sky's gonna' open up with a rain of heavenly bloodshed and glorious violence!" - Kled
"I am the brutal instrument of my own destiny!" - Kled
"Ain't nobody gonna' give you nothing. Gotta' take it yourself." - Kled
"Impossible ain't a Noxian word." - Kled
"I didn't become a Rear Forward Brigadier Admiral from running!" - Kled
"I don't need that lizard! Kled's got his own ideas." - Kled
"I don't need nothing but this axe... and this gun... and this hat." - Kled
"Why's all these intruders so far away?" - Kled
"I know that lizard ain't talking, but I still hear him. Shut up, lizard. Shut up!" - Kled
"Stop talking, you stupid brain badgers!" - Kled
"Hey, what was that? Of course I don't need Skaarl... but he helps." - Kled
"What was that? Run straight into the tower?" - Kled
"I don't need a team to start a teamfight!" - Kled
"Sure! I'll kill all of them myself!" - Kled
"I don't need you Skaarl!" - Kled
"I said I wasn't not backing off, no how!" - Kled
"Even if I lose, I win! Just means I get to come back and kill you later!" - Kled
"I know you're listening, brain weasels! I ain't falling for it!" - Kled
"I am Sir Admiral Major Kled, and I smell a victory potpourri!" - Kled
"First thing you learn as a Lieutenant Sergeant Commodore: rely only on yourself." - Kled
"Skaarl! Come back, buddy! Skaarl?" - Kled
"Damnit, Skaarl! I hate walking!" - Kled
"I didn't not earn the rank of Sergeant double Admiral by not running!" - Kled
"Folks say I got violent tendencies." Kled laughs. - Kled
"Oh, she'll see, she'll see! She'll come strolling back when I turn them interlopers into a pure." - Kled
"Ain't nobody tough as Kled! I've got gravel in my guts and a fire in my head!" - Kled
"Don't worry, them voices ain't telling me to kill you no more...! Yeah, of course we still gonna' kill 'im." - Kled
"You do realise... you're on my property?" - Kled
"I figure I'll help you kill 'em... before I kill you." - Kled
"Usually I find conversation boring and useless. You remind me I'm right." - Kled
"You feel like arguing about something? It'll make what happens later easier for you." - Kled
"So... when exactly you planning on getting the hell outta' here?" - Kled
"Woo, no sir, I ain't gonna' kill you and feed you to my lizard! Them's just... malicious rumours!" - Kled
"Oh, before I forget, what, uh... rank are you, exactly?" - Kled
"You may be from Noxus, but you ain't Noxian." - Kled
"Don't mess with Noxus, brother." - Kled
"You know, I like you, brother. As much as I can like a lily-livered jungle-sniffer." - Kled
"You sure you're Noxian? You look a little Ionian to me." - Kled
"Watch your stepping! That's my land you're gallivanting on!" - Kled
"Drinking from battle? What kind of dumb crap is that?" - Kled
"Telling people you're a god? Hell, you're barely a paring knife." - Kled
"Something caught in your throat? 'cause you sound desperate!" - Kled
"Say that again! I dare you." - Kled
"Thems fighting words! See, Skaarl? That's why I don't like people." - Kled
"Shut your mouth hole! Them badgers are listening." - Kled
"I'm just a Yordle standing in front of you, asking you to shut the hell up!" - Kled
"Of course you realize, this means war." - Kled
"So, that's what considered funny in the city, huh?" - Kled
"I got a joke too! It's called me kicking your teeth in!" - Kled
"That it? That was your joke, huh?" - Kled
"Was you making fun of my Skaarl?" - Kled
"Real funny! Knew a funny guy in the Draken Campaign - took a javelin in the spine, couldn't walk after that. Used him as a coat rack." - Kled
"Don't get weird on me!" - Kled
"Dang nabbit, you're gonna' get us killed!" - Kled
"Calm down, you damn-!" Kled curses. - Kled
"Whoa! Whoa! Don't get excited, now!" - Kled
"Don't get your britches all rumpled!" - Kled
"Calm down, girl!" - Kled
"Whoa, Skaarl, whoa!" - Kled
"Skaarl, I got this!" - Kled
"Don't you run off on me! Skaarl!" - Kled
"Easy, girl, easy!" - Kled
"Quit your worryin'!" - Kled
"No Skaarl, no! Bad Skaarl!" - Kled
"Hey! We ain't done!" - Kled
"Get back here you-!" Kled curses. - Kled
"Darn nabbit! You lily-livered flea bucket!" - Kled
Kled curses. "What are you doing?" - Kled
"I knew you was a coward!" - Kled
"I ain't never forgiving you, you flea-bitten-!" Kled curses. - Kled
"Go home, get! I never needed you no how!" - Kled
"Not again!" - Kled
"No, no! The other way! Get back here!" - Kled
"The fighting's this way!" - Kled
Kled curses. "You stupid, dumb animal!" - Kled
Kled curses. - Kled
Kled curses. "Get back here, you---" Kled curses. - Kled
Kled curses. "I will--- I ain't backing down! I don't back down! Never!" - Kled
Kled curses. "Where you going? We got 'em right where we want 'em!" - Kled
Kled curses. "Now I gotta' walk!" - Kled
"Traitor!" - Kled
Kled curses. "Fine! I'll kill 'em!" - Kled
Kled curses. "I'll take 'em alone!" - Kled
"Yeah!" - Rakan
"Yahoo!" - Kled
"Wahoo!" - Kled
"Now we got 'em!" - Kled
"If you does that one more time I'll skewer you and roast you myself!" - Kled
"Where you been?" - Kled
"Get over here, buddy!" - Kled
"Woo, good timing!" - Kled
"I knew you'd be back." - Kled
"Dang nabbit, I love this lizard!" - Kled
"Boy am I glad to see you!" - Kled

"How's that dirt taste?" - Kled
"Don't worry, Skaarl! We'll come back so you can eat 'em later." - Kled
"Whoops! Looks like I accidentally stabbed you with my long axe - until you were dead!" - Kled
"You were a visitor, now you're mulch!" - Kled
"Skaarl, that was what we call a predictable scenario." - Kled
"I told 'em what was gonna' happen if they came onto my land!" - Kled
"Next time you visit, bring more stuff I can take!" - Kled
"I might be a deranged lizard-riding bandito, but I whooped you real good!" - Kled
"Now, I might have overreacted to you unlawfully entering my property - but I don't think so!" - Kled
"Ahahahaha! I warned him! I did warn him!" - Kled
"It's funny, 'cause he died right on the border of my land, and more off my land!" - Kled
"Glad you could visit!" - Kled
"Don't let the door hit you on your way to hell!" - Kled
"Tried to bushwhack a bushwhacker!" - Kled
"That learned 'em real good." - Kled
"We didn't come here to teach lessons in humanity!" - Kled
"Y'all made a nice stabbing bag." - Kled
"Killing makes me thirsty." - Kled
"Nothing like a river of blood to send a message." - Kled
"Y'know, a long time ago, being crazy meant something." - Kled
"Just 'cause we was kin don't mean I ain't feeding you to Skaarl!" - Kled
"Hey cous', glad you came to visit!" - Kled
"A relative's just another unwanted guest." - Kled
"Afraid I had to cut your visit short." - Kled
"You ain't cute now!" - Kled
"Aw, you are so cute... 'fore I ripped your fuzzy head off!" - Kled
"I could feel bad about killing you, or we could stomp on your corpse!" - Kled
"You was cute - lousy, but cute." - Kled
"He died as dumb as he sounded." - Kled
"And he ain't even had the indignity to call himself a demon." - Kled
"Never had much to say, but I'm sure glad we shut him up." - Kled
"Girl was all messed up."	 Skaarl growls	   "I mean, before we killed her. Snake for legs? Crazy!" - Kled
"I guess it's snake dinner tonight!" - Kled
"Was that lady half-snake, or that snake half-human? She is... confusing. Dead, but confusing." - Kled
"Hey, lizard food! What exactly was you general of?" - Kled
"Nice axe! Learn to use it!" - Kled
"Death by my hand!" - Kled
"He wanted to unify Noxus. Guess that makes me a secessionist." - Kled
"KLEEEEEED... naw, it's just Kled." - Kled
"Who wants some Kled?" - Kled
"This is where Kled shines!" - Kled
"Skaarl? You eatin' good tonight! That girl's got some meat on her!" - Kled
"And you thought I talked crazy!" - Kled
"I gotta' stop the mushroom juice... I swear that girl had some tentacles or something!" - Kled
"Bye bye, fancy pants!" - Kled
"Hey, fancy pants! Got your cloak dirty!" - Kled
"I don't know what he was. I just needed him to shut up." - Kled
"I can respect crazy, but what kind of fool reloads in the middle of a fight?" - Kled
"A sinister blade? Heck, girl, Skaarl's got farts more sinister than you was." - Kled
"I like a girl with moxie."	 Skaarl growls	   "No, obviously she didn't have any! That's the darn point!" - Kled
"Humans is such easy prey." - Kled
"She had one crazy getup! Them city-folk clothes is getting ridiculous."	 Skaarl growls	   "Yeah, I'll try it on later." - Kled
"Go back to Noxus Prime!" - Kled
"All your little city-girl dreams just got stomped." - Kled
"We wrecked that thing!" - Kled
"Damn varmint left holes all over the yard." - Kled
"Queen of what? Darn thing made Skaarl look smart!" - Kled
"Pure Noxian girl. Almost liked her. Almost." - Kled
"Seems to have lost your bounce, girl." - Kled
"All that hippy hop! Getting on my nerves!" - Kled
"How many times do I gotta' kill him?"	 Skaarl growls	   "I know!" - Kled
"Too stupid to live, too dumb to die." - Kled
"I don't think you can eat that one."	 Skaarl growls	   "He looks a little overripe." - Kled
"Huh. I liked him better when he was alive." - Kled
"Tactician? More like bird brain." - Kled
"Master Tactician? He can keep that title." - Kled

"You soul is a fetid, stagnant pool, untouched by the tide!" - Illaoi
"You are not free from death! You are dead." - Illaoi
"You powers are stolen from the flow. You have damned your homeland." - Illaoi
"Abomination! You are without motion." - Illaoi
"You suffered... but learned nothing." - Illaoi
"What is truly noble and good would never ask you to serve another!" - Illaoi

"Go back to where men are weak, and need your inspiration." - Illaoi
"We know your true name. We do not fear you." - Illaoi
"Life is not balance. It is motion!" - Illaoi
"Your god was forgotten. Mine cannot be ignored." - Illaoi
"False prophet! You don't even serve a true god!" - Illaoi
"You move well. Now, you must only find joy in the motion." - Illaoi
"I broke men's hearts. I broke men's spines. You're the first who's going to get both." - Illaoi

"Your god offers light without wisdom." - Illaoi
"It is you who have shown Gangplank his path. For that, I thank you." - Illaoi
"Gangplank was drowning. Your actions reminded him to swim." - Illaoi
"You are in motion - but only as a parasite on a host." - Illaoi
"Ugly thing. You weren't designed by god, you were made by fools." - Illaoi
"Creature, you move - but are useless." - Illaoi
"You are a foul creation - born from ignorance." - Illaoi
"What kind of stupid god made you?" - Illaoi
"They have cheated you of rebirth." - Illaoi
"You move only from hunger that consumes itself." - Illaoi
"Creature, why would I listen to lies when I can see the truth?" - Illaoi
"Your fine words don't disguise your foul design." - Illaoi
"Aw, child, you are cute, but I doubt you will be for long." - Illaoi
"Change, or feel my god's wrath." - Illaoi
"Move!" - Illaoi
"Now!" - Illaoi

"This is the motion. All is Nagakabouros." - Illaoi
"I do not walk alone. I am with my god. It is here." - Illaoi
"You cannot hide from god. You cannot hide from the test." - Illaoi
"Live your journey - or die in mine." - Illaoi
"Your spirit is held - take it if you can." - Illaoi
"What you desire, you must take." - Illaoi
"You speak of having a soul. It was never yours. None of them were." - Illaoi
"Fear is good. Use it." - Illaoi
"Change, or you will be pulled down." - Illaoi
"Our mother demands your tithe." - Illaoi
"You are drowning - I want you to swim." - Illaoi
"Your soul drowns. Fight." - Illaoi
"Take back your spirit." - Illaoi
"Each of your lives has served the vortex." - Illaoi
"Death is only one outcome." - Illaoi
"We learn from action. Move, or die." - Illaoi
"This... is... the test." - Illaoi
"This will be a good day - if you live." - Illaoi
"Drive forward - it is destiny that calls you." - Illaoi
"Love, fight, live." - Illaoi
"Seize today, and you've earned tomorrow." - Illaoi
"Fight and die with purpose." - Illaoi
"My god doesn't want you to kneel. It wants you to fight." - Illaoi
"You have been given the tools to know your destiny." - Illaoi
"The failure of your lives is written on your soul." - Illaoi
"Now... do you see the truth?" - Illaoi
"We are all free. Seeing the truth only reminds us." - Illaoi
"Each moment is earned." - Illaoi
"All of us are lost, all of us are blind. You must swim towards your destiny." - Illaoi
"Countless lifetimes lead our bodies foward, and drive our spirits towards their true destiny." - Illaoi
"I don't want you to fail, I want you to learn." - Illaoi
"Child, you must earn your soul. Prove yourself." - Illaoi
"The battle is lost only when you surrender. Fight for your soul." - Illaoi
"You are the tinest sliver of energy held briefly in shape. Where this energy flows is your destiny." - Illaoi
"This moment is waiting to be seized." - Illaoi
"Every day is waiting to be taken." - Illaoi
"I don't want you to worship. I want you to learn." - Illaoi
"I will break you if that's what it takes." - Illaoi
"Give up, and your life is nothing." - Illaoi
"Each lifetime is a spirit. Each lifetime is a chance. Take it." - Illaoi
"Not bad! At least you're moving." - Illaoi
"Perhaps you're not hopeless after all." - Illaoi
"Yes, you are learning." - Illaoi
"This is how you learn." - Illaoi
"Don't stop!" - Illaoi
"Good, this is the lesson." - Illaoi
"Do not tire, do not slow, push onward." - Illaoi
"Exactly. If you want your soul, take it." - Illaoi
"Keep going, keep striving. This is our way." - Illaoi
"Again. Push onward." - Illaoi
"Ha! Well done." - Illaoi
"Better." - Illaoi
"Your souls wait for you. Take them back if you can." - Illaoi
"This is the way of Nagakabouros - motion!" - Illaoi
"Finally, now you are in motion." - Illaoi
"To challenge, to fight... this pleases Nagakabouros." - Illaoi
"You have learned the first lesson." - Illaoi
"Pray I don't have to teach you again." - Illaoi
"Nagakabouros accepts your tithe." - Illaoi
"You swim well." - Illaoi
"Learn well, or you will be tested again." - Illaoi
"You are in motion." - Illaoi
"You have been tested. You have done well." - Illaoi
"Don't make me test you again." - Illaoi
"Did you blunder into victory, or did you learn?" - Illaoi
"Kabouros!" - Illaoi
"Shai!" - Illaoi
"The truth!" - Illaoi
"Naga-sho!" - Illaoi
"Altak!" - Illaoi
"This is motion!" - Illaoi
"All is Nagakabouros!" - Illaoi
"All is motion!" - Illaoi
"You cannot hide!" - Illaoi
"It is not what we have, it is what we can throw away." - Illaoi
"Things should be held only when we need them." - Illaoi
"Only what moves, only what lives... has value." - Illaoi
"When I am done with this... it will make a fine offering." - Illaoi
"I like this. I should buy everyone one of these." - Illaoi
"I am going to walk all over them." - Illaoi
"My god is motion, but speed is useful." - Illaoi
"This fits me better than Gangplank." - Illaoi
"Who is Randuin? Was she a priestess?" - Illaoi
"Sterak? It is the fury of the mother I will bring." - Illaoi
"The Kraken. The Serpent. The Hydra. A god's appearance is limited only by those observing it." - Illaoi
"It is my god that protects me - but these metal clothes are nice." - Illaoi

"Say yeah!" - Rakan
"Oh yeah!" - Rakan
"Watch me!" - Rakan
Xayah: "Are you having fun over there?""	 Rakan: "I can't hear you over all the fun I'm having!" - Xayah
Rakan: "The fight's here!, by me!"	 Xayah: "It's the same fight!" - Xayah
Xayah: "You're doing this!"	 Rakan: "Doing it!" - Xayah
Xayah: "I hate everyone today!"	 Rakan: "Even me?"	 Xayah: "Not you, baby." - Xayah
Rakan: "Should we give them a fighting chance?"	 Xayah: "Only if we want to have fun." - Xayah
Rakan: "Who do I hit?"	 Xayah: "One of them!"	 Rakan: "Ah." - Xayah
Xayah: "This reminds me of our first dates!"	 Rakan: "Good times!" - Xayah
Xayah: "Mind if I cut in, Rakan?"	 Rakan: " Be my guest, miella!" - Xayah
Rakan: "That was beautiful, baby!" - Xayah
Rakan: "You see that?"	 Xayah: "I couldn't miss it!" - Xayah
Xayah: "Make them remember!"	 Rakan: "They'll never forget." - Xayah
Xayah: "Let's show 'em what we got."	 Rakan: "Happily." - Xayah
Rakan: "You love it when I slap fools?"	 Xayah: "You know I do!" - Xayah
Rakan: "This is the plan, right?"	 Xayah: "It is now!" - Xayah
Rakan: "What do you want to do later?"	 Xayah: "I can think of something." - Xayah
Rakan: "You hungry?"	 Xayah: "Can we talk about this later?"	 Rakan: "But... but... food!" - Xayah
Xayah: "You're cute today!"	 Rakan: "Eyes on the prize, baby." - Xayah
Rakan: "Let me at 'em!"	 Xayah: "Rakan is very enthusiastic." - Xayah
Rakan: "I want to show 'em!"	 Xayah: "I adore your energy." - Xayah
Rakan: "Do we need any of these fools?"	 Xayah: "Not a single one." - Xayah
Xayah: "Use your words!"	 Rakan: "Can't! Punching!" - Xayah
Rakan: "I have your back!" - Xayah
Xayah: "I have your back!" - Xayah
Xayah: "How long since we last danced?"	 Rakan: "Too long." - Xayah
Rakan: "These guys look silly!"	 Xayah: "Bunch of weirdos." - Xayah
Rakan: "How many fights we gotta win?"	 Xayah: "All of them!" - Xayah
"Our magic is a fury. It is a song you cannot resist." - Rakan
"Should I be... running? Yeah, I should... probably be running." - Rakan
"I look around these forests and I see freedom. I hear the music." - Rakan
"Crap. I totally forgot why I'm here." - Rakan
"I am only as wild as magic." - Rakan
"Magic is supposed to be scary. Love is supposed to hurt. Ecstasy needs a little fear." - Rakan
"If you aren't a little frightened, you ain't alive." - Rakan
"They've never seen moves like mine." - Rakan
"Magic is a wilderness." - Rakan
"Humans made promises. More than I can remember. They kept none." - Rakan
"Humans talk about their treaties. We talk about their lies." - Rakan
"Long ago, our kind danced upon the mountains like flames. Now only the embers remain." - Rakan
"I dance because I'm free!" - Rakan
"The only way to understand magic is to plunge into it, move with it, dance and dance!" - Rakan
"I'm getting impatient." - Rakan
"Gotta get myself hyped, okay... one, two... one, two... woo! Alright!" - Rakan
"The humans call it battle. It's just a dance." - Rakan
"I feel like my allies aren't recognising how amazing my cloak is! I mean, seriously! Rude!" - Rakan
"They will see my dance, then they will know magic's joy... and its fury." - Rakan
"Okay, Rakan, get 'em watching you, then you burn 'em up." - Rakan
"I look good, I feel good, let's kick some ass!" - Rakan
"I got my look right, I got my moves right... time to show it!" - Rakan
"They will remember my name!" - Rakan
"I'm gonna' live forever!" - Rakan
"I'm going to take all they got, then laugh as I throw it away." - Rakan
"I've been kicked around since I was born. It's alright! It's okay! I'm staying alive!" - Rakan
"They will see me. They will see my dance!" - Rakan
"I will walk in. I will dance. They will party." - Rakan
"Name one genius that ain't crazy." - Rakan
"Ha! I'm G to the D! Golden diamonds, boy! Woo!" - Rakan
"I'm just trying to live the moment." - Rakan
"I don't need anything - but the right now." - Rakan
Rakan sings. - Xayah
"Man, have you seen that forest over there?" - Rakan
"I got freedom, I got a lady, I got a cause I'd die for. That's who I am." - Rakan
"Don't leave nothing! Bring it all!" - Rakan
"Time to get it started!" - Rakan
"I don't need to understand the plan! I trust my love." - Rakan
"It's all filthy and dangerous - and that's why I love it!" - Rakan
"I miss Xayah." - Rakan
"Fun. I need some fun. Now." - Rakan
"Why is it taking so long to get back to the action?" - Rakan
"It's a revolution. And it's good times." - Rakan
"I'm offended by how little attention I was given." - Rakan
"Humans think that to believe in something, you have to be serious about it. That's their problem." - Rakan
"They ain't ready for what I'm bringing!" - Rakan
"Ain't nothing I say should be taken seriously! That's why it's the truth!" - Rakan
Rakan raps. - Rakan
"This looks like another dangerous situation. Thankfully, I can improvise." - Rakan
"They're gonna' try and test me? Haha!" - Rakan
"Danger is as fun as you let it be." - Rakan
"I am definitely more confident in dangerous situations." - Rakan
"I have got to stop talking to myself. Damnit, Xayah, where are you?" - Rakan
"You're only given a little spark of madness. You mustn't lose it." - Rakan
"I can't wait to see what I'm going to do." - Rakan
"There's wildness in the bees and the flowers. It's just a fury humans don't see." - Rakan
"I am Vastaya. I am born of magic. This is my destiny." - Rakan
"Is my cloak right? Yes it is! I was worried there for a second." - Rakan
"Magic isn't supposed to be safe." - Rakan
"They're scared of darkness, they're scared of magic. They are scared of where I'm from." - Rakan
"They ain't seen moves like mine." - Rakan
"It's magic that's wild. I'm just here for the party." - Rakan
"For humans, magic is like fire. For us, it is water and air." - Rakan
"Ladies and gentleman, I am here to entertain! Myself, mostly - but you too!" - Rakan
"Humans claim it is theirs. They fence us away and cover it in refuse." - Rakan
"It don't take a lot of words to tell the truth." - Rakan
"Our people are bleeding. My lady's gonna' heal them." - Rakan
"I don't want a world that's safe." - Rakan
"I don't want a war - but I want to be free." - Rakan
"What human's call magic, we call life." - Rakan
"I'm here! I'm gone, I am so gone." - Rakan
"I am a chronic line-stepper." - Rakan
"I dance because I'm free." - Rakan
"If Xayah says someone has to die, they die - and they deserved it." - Rakan
"Woo! I am so into this! What is this?" - Rakan
"If it don't get out of control, it ain't a party." - Rakan
"I think they underestimate my charm. How is that even possible?" - Rakan
"I'm so fine, I gotta kiss myself!" - Rakan
"They think they can catch me." - Rakan
"I don't do safe." - Rakan
"The universe loves me." - Rakan
"They want us in cages. We refuse." - Rakan
"I need my love to hurt. I need the world to be scary. I don't apologise for it! I feel good!" - Rakan
"I'm gonna' burn this place down, then help them build it back up - so I can burn it again!" - Rakan
"I dance so fine I kill." - Rakan
"Xayah? Hey! Damn, where is she? I hate it when she leaves." - Rakan
"Without wild magic, we have no children, we have no future." - Rakan
"When I get sad, I stop being sad and be awesome instead. True story." - Rakan
"I do not wish to kill the mortals. I want them to hear the music." - Rakan
"The humans will never understand our kind until they hear the song." - Rakan
"I will make them dance. I will make them hear." - Rakan
Rakan: " Hey, Xayah."	 Xayah: "Yeah?"	 Rakan: "You sexy." - Xayah
Xayah: "Keep them distracted."	 Rakan: "That shouldn't be a problem." - Xayah
Rakan: "You okay?"	 Xayah: "I'm fine."	 Rakan: "You're pushing yourself too hard."	 Xayah: "It has to be done." - Xayah
Rakan: "Where are we going?"	 Xayah: "You forgot the plan."	 Rakan: "No, I... yeah. Hey, have you seen this cape?" - Xayah
Xayah: "You remember the Affay waterfall?"	 Rakan: "Yeah."	 Xayah: "I'd like to go there again."	 Rakan: "Well, try not to die then." - Rakan
Rakan: "Darling?"	 Xayah: "Yes?"	 Rakan: "Pay attention to me." - Xayah
Xayah: "What the hell were you thinking?"	 Rakan: "Back there?"	 Xayah: "Yes."	 Rakan: "I wasn't. I never think. Ugh... thinking." - Xayah
Rakan: "How can humans not hear the magic?"	 Xayah: "They're too busy building things."	 Rakan: "Why?"	 Xayah: "Because... they're afraid." - Xayah
Rakan: "Thanks."	 Xayah: "For what?"	 Rakan: "Not saying 'I told you so.'" - Xayah
Xayah: "Okay, last time, it was totally my fault."	 Rakan: "What was?"	 Xayah: "Good answer." - Xayah
Rakan: "You going to marry me today?"	 Xayah: "Ask me again tomorrow."	 Rakan: "I always do." - Xayah
Rakan: "Do you love me because I'm beautiful, or because I'm sexy?"	 Xayah: "Not now!"	 Rakan: "Love is so cruel!" - Xayah
Rakan: "What's after this?"	 Xayah: "Another road, another horizon."	 Rakan: "Hm. Good." - Xayah
Rakan: "It's gonna' be okay."	 Xayah: "We can do this."	 Rakan: "Hey, I know that." - Xayah
Rakan: "You know I love you."	 Xayah: "What we have is greater than some human word." - Xayah
Rakan: "Did you notice the sky?"	 Xayah: "It's lovely."	 Rakan: "Not as beautiful as you." - Xayah
Rakan: "I am R-r-r-akan!"	 Xayah: "Ugh, what's with the accent?"	 Rakan: "I'm... trying something new. Do you like it?"	 Xayah: "No. No, I do not." - Xayah
Xayah: "If you need me, whistle. You know how to whistle, don't you?"	 Rakan: "Hubba hubba."	 Xayah: "No, that's not whistling." - Xayah
Xayah: "If you don't want to do this... "	 Rakan: "No! I want to!"	 Xayah: "You're only here because of me."	 Rakan: "... nah. Freedom fighting is a good look for me." - Xayah
Rakan: "What are those things humans wear on their feet?"	 Xayah: "Shoes."	 Rakan: "I need shoes. Red ones. I need them so bad." - Xayah
Rakan: "Did I tell you I love you?"	 Xayah: "Yes... but say it anyway."	 Rakan: "I love you." - Xayah
Rakan: "Why do you never say yes?"	 Xayah: "'cause then... I wouldn't get to hear you ask." - Xayah
Rakan: "Can we just stay here?"	 Xayah: "We must keep moving."	 Rakan: "Aw... " - Xayah
Rakan: "Xayah? I think we got a problem... "	 Xayah: "Think, or know?"	 Rakan: "I... know we got a problem?" - Xayah
Xayah: "I'm so tired... "	 Rakan: "You gotta rest, honey."	 Xayah: "Everyone is depending on me."	 Rakan: "Everyone can wait." - Xayah
Rakan: "What would you do if I died?"	 Xayah: "I would... burn this world to the ground and build a castle from the ashes, where I would live alone forever."	 Rakan: "Aw... that's sweet." - Xayah
Xayah: "I think scars are sexy."	 Rakan: "Okay. I'll get more." - Xayah
Xayah: "Where do we go?"	 Rakan: "Wherever our hearts desire." - Xayah
Rakan: "How do you like me today?"	 Xayah: "More than yesterday, less than tomorrow." - Xayah
Xayah: "Do I make you happy, Rakan?"	 Rakan: "Every day of my life." - Xayah
Xayah: "I'm lucky to have you."	 Rakan: "No. I'm the lucky one." - Xayah
Xayah: "I swear, you will be the death of me."	 Rakan: "I'm fine with that."	 Xayah: "Me too." - Xayah
Rakan asks something in Vastayan.	 Xayah replies in Vastayan.	 Xayah and Rakan laugh. - Xayah
Xayah: "If we get separated, I'll find you."	 Rakan: "We won't get separated."	 Xayah: "You're already wandering off."	 Rakan: "No, I'm not! ... only a little." - Xayah
Rakan: "You are stunning and beautiful... "	 Xayah: "Why, thank you, darling."	 Rakan: "Yes. I was... definitely talking about you, honey." - Xayah
Xayah: "I need you to be more careful."	 Rakan: "If anybody's gonna' die first, it's gonna' be me. I can't see you die. Also, black is a terrible color on me." - Xayah
Xayah: "Play it safe!"	 Rakan: "Baby, I don't do safe!" - Xayah
Xayah: "You okay?"	 Rakan: "Oh, this is all so intense!" - Xayah
Rakan: "You can't tell me you weren't impressed!"	 Xayah: "With what?"	 Rakan: "Just generally! I'm amazing!" - Xayah
Xayah: "Honey, what are you doing?"	 Rakan: "I can't die looking this good!" - Xayah
Rakan: "After this, how about we get some human food?"	 Xayah: "A nice dinner?"	 Rakan: "Chocolate!"	 Xayah: "That's not what---"	 Rakan: "We're eating chocolate!" - Xayah
Xayah: "Do you remember the plan?"	 Rakan: "Nope, but let's do it!" - Xayah
Rakan: "I have a cunning plan."	 Xayah: "Really? What is it?"	 Rakan: "I'm not going to tell you. That's the really cunning bit!" - Xayah
Rakan: "I think you intimidate human females."	 Xayah: "Yeah, so?"	 Rakan: "It's kinda hot!" - Xayah
Rakan: "Should I show them the dance?"	 Xayah: "Show them the dance." - Xayah
Rakan: "You thinking about me?"	 Xayah: "I'm a little busy!"	 Rakan: "That's very upsetting!" - Xayah
Xayah: "Baby, what did I tell you?"	 Rakan: "Try not to die?"	 Xayah: "Close enough." - Xayah
Rakan: "Did you see the clothes those guys were wearing?"	 Xayah: "Yeah, gross." - Xayah
Rakan: "Rakan has arrived!"	 Xayah: "I saw you. Everyone can see you."	 Rakan: "Yeah! That's what I like!" - Xayah
Rakan: "Can I start off?"	 Xayah: "You want to start it off?"	 Rakan: "Let's start it off!" - Xayah
Rakan: "I'm a humble entertainer!"	 Xayah: "Really, darling?"	 Rakan: "Yeah, I'm the best." - Xayah
Rakan: "Who is that gorgeous thing over there?"	 Xayah: "Now's not the time, darling."	 Rakan: "It's always the time!" - Xayah
Rakan: "Hey, I'm not gonna kill you, she is! Say hi, honey."	 Xayah: "Hi." - Xayah
Rakan: "I'm handling it, dear."	 Xayah: "Are you?"	 Rakan: "I was, I--- I will." - Xayah
Rakan: "How long do we fight?"	 Xayah: "Until we are free. Until magic is free."	 Rakan: "Is that after lunch?" - Xayah
Xayah: "Do you remember our escape route?"	 Rakan: "Uh... yes?"	 Xayah: "I'll take that as a no." - Xayah
Rakan: "How will we know if the plan works?"	 Xayah: "We'll still be alive!" - Xayah
Xayah: "Woo, shake those tail feathers, baby!"	 Rakan: "I am not a piece of meat." - Xayah
Rakan: "Caw caw, caw caw!"	 Xayah: "You used the secret call! Is everything alright?"	 Rakan: "We have a secret call? I just like that sound! Caw caw!" - Xayah
Xayah: "Hey, I need you here! Uh, never mind, just... go that way!"	 Rakan: "No-one can control me!"	 Xayah: "That's right, babe." - Xayah
Xayah: "Look sharp, baby."	 Rakan: "Ha! When don't I?" - Xayah
Rakan: "If I vanish, what would you do?"	 Xayah: "I would never be whole again." - Xayah
Rakan: "Am I good to you?"	 Xayah: "The best." - Xayah
Rakan: "I'm going rogue!"	 Xayah: "There's a surprise." - Xayah
Rakan: "Be right back!"	 Xayah: "Will you?"	 Rakan: "Who can know these things?"	 Xayah: "You! You can know these things!" - Xayah
Xayah: "I love you!"	 Rakan: "I know." - Xayah
"Do you want to smell it? Not for you!" - Rakan
"You want to smell it? No flower for you!" - Rakan
"You know, I ain't really about making fun of people, but you... make that difficult." - Rakan
"I got three rules. You're breaking two of them with that outfit." - Rakan
"Can we just get started already?" - Rakan
"Why are you so boring?" - Rakan
"Man, are you digging this air?" - Rakan
"Oh, you're bumming me out." - Rakan
"Is... 'totally bogus' your thing?" - Rakan
"So, when you got dressed this morning, was this the look you were going for?" - Rakan
"There's this thing called grooming. You should try it." - Rakan
"Hey, I'm right here. So, can you be less uptight and lame now?" - Rakan
Rakan: "I ain't gonna' kill you. She is!"	 Xayah: "Nice to unmeet you." - Xayah
Rakan: "Kiss me, honey."	 Xayah: "Why now?"	 Rakan: "Give them a pretty last image." - Xayah
"So, just tiger stuff? Buddy, you've got to mix it up." - Rakan
"I know you're Vastaya, but your tribe... lacks style!" - Rakan
"So, you just... run around in the jungle, huh? I mean, I'm not judging, if that's what you're into. Nerd." - Rakan
Xayah: "I think we're supposed to laugh, now?"	 Rakan: "At what?" - Xayah
Xayah: "Smile and nod, honey."	 Rakan: "Can we leave now?" - Xayah
"Come on!" - Rakan
"Party started!" - Rakan
"Oh! Yeah!" - Rakan
"This is the drop!" - Rakan
"Come on, fool thought he could match my style?" - Rakan
"Got a feeling I shouldn't have done that." - Rakan
"I'm not about killing - but I'll put in the work." - Rakan
"Whoops. Now you are dead." - Rakan
"Ugh. Sorry about that." - Rakan
"Party foul!" - Rakan
"Step up again, I'll slap you down again." - Rakan
"Woo! I feel good!" - Rakan
"Also, your look is played out." - Rakan
"I got the deadly fresh style!" - Rakan
"Oh! Can't touch this!" - Rakan
"The dance is deadly." - Rakan
"I find this parallel universe stuff very upsetting." - Rakan
"Well. I always was the pretty one." - Rakan
"Hello, world! I am single now!" - Rakan
"I bet she's going to be angry about that later." - Rakan
"I miss her already. Oh well." - Rakan
"Your kind started this war. We will end it." - Rakan
"You put us in a cage? I put you in the ground." - Rakan
"We don't want your harmony! We want our freedom!" - Rakan
"I showed you the dance. You should've moved." - Rakan
"I don't want to like killing, but this time, I did." - Rakan
"You thought you got away?" - Rakan
"You came to visit us! Did you think we would forget?" - Rakan
"I remembered your trespass." - Rakan
"You were a shadow without a flame." - Rakan
"Messed with my girl. What did you think I was going to do?" - Rakan
"He had some style - for a human." - Rakan
"Punk ass cape." - Rakan
"Fool thought he could upstage me?" - Rakan
"Problem with that guy? No talent." - Rakan
"Another. Dead. Poser." - Rakan
"Kind of feel bad for the guy. His feathers were weak." - Rakan
"Punk was trying too hard." - Rakan
"Power was not meant to be contained. Now, it is free." - Rakan
"You were given Vastayan blood, yet chose to be blind." - Rakan
"It is from our blood your gifts came, and my hand that took it back." - Rakan
"One animal at a time? Weak." - Rakan
"What was with that girl's dumb purse?" - Rakan
"Girl thought she could pull out my soul - but I got too much soul!" - Rakan
"Big girl had too much going on." - Rakan
"Six legs. Still couldn't dance." - Rakan
"Was that a land shark? I mean, why? Why is that a thing?" - Rakan
"Perfect predator? I got an instinct about how stupid that thing was." - Rakan

"I need to see if people can see how awesome I am!" - Rakan
"When you open your eyes, you see everything is limitless." - Rakan
"I need to know when the action's coming." - Rakan
"Well I don't want to miss the start of the party." - Rakan
"I dig seeing stuff." - Rakan
"The world's a big place. Don't want to miss any of it." - Rakan
"I'm pretty sure I'm supposed to scout around. Pretty, pretty sure." - Rakan
"I'll just put that there. That's a good place. I hope. Yeah... " - Rakan
"Let's see what's happening now." - Rakan
"Yep, if I'm going to see the human world I need to start." - Rakan
"I'm going to show people some of the strange." - Rakan
"Peekaboo." - Rakan
"I am not blind to any possibility." - Rakan
"I know people are watching. How could they not be?" - Rakan
"If you look at things the right way, it's awesome." - Rakan
"The world isn't about collecting stuff, it's about seeing stuff." - Rakan
"Turn in, turn on, drop out." - Rakan
"The sleeper must awaken." - Rakan
"Mankind is blind. I want them to see." - Rakan
"Vision is the first step towards understanding." - Rakan
"Aw, crap, I hate having to have a plan." - Rakan
"I live in the moment." - Rakan
"I think Xayah told me to improvise. At least, that's the only part of the plan I remember." - Rakan
"Let's see what these animals can do." - Rakan
"I... totally forgot why I'm here." - Rakan
"Our kind will see the truth soon enough." - Rakan
"I want to feel everything. That's the only way to live." - Rakan
"Every road leads someplace." - Rakan
"Hello? Anybody there?" - Rakan
"Rakan, doing his job." - Rakan
"I should totally get paid for this." - Rakan
"Let's go! Baby! Baby? Baby? Baby!" - Rakan
"Want to catch a ride?" - Rakan
"You got to keep up, baby!" - Rakan
"Better hurry up!" - Rakan
"Rakan out." - Rakan
"Coming?" - Rakan
"Damn... " - Rakan
"Not like this... " - Rakan
"Open... casket... " - Rakan
"I can never resist an invitation to dance." - Xayah
"Fine, I'll just be over here... sharpening my feathers." - Xayah
"If love is feeling so deeply for another that you want to chew your way under their skin, then I love Rakan... " - Xayah
"The Vastayan named the world. We named the trees, the wind, the mountains. We know their power." - Xayah
"The world owes the Vastaya a great debt. I'm here to collect." - Xayah
"I'm just an ordinary girl. An ordinary girl with an infinite supply of death quills." - Xayah
"They'll probably label me a war criminal one day, but not today." - Xayah
"We pledged ourselves to each other in the middle of a tavern brawl. The whole place reeked of vomit, sweat and blood. It was so romantic!" - Xayah
"Ah, silence, so golden. Like Rakan. Kind of miss him. Even if he is... noisy." - Xayah
"Let's cut 'em to ribbons." - Xayah
"Dance like your life depends on it." - Xayah
"Dance." - Xayah
"Move your feet, or lose some toes." - Xayah
"Compromise. It's a pain." - Xayah
"Call me cute again." - Xayah
"This is how I deal with unwanted attention." - Xayah
"This is a preemptive 'No'." - Xayah
"Keep up." - Xayah
"A dance with me ends in blood." - Xayah
"Hear. My. Words!" - Xayah
"Hm, what shall I cut off?" - Xayah
"I don't speak compromise." - Xayah
"I always find a weak spot." - Xayah
"A thousand cuts is only the beginning." - Xayah
"Cut by a feather? So delicate." - Xayah
"Violence is my favorite form of negotiation." - Xayah
"My feathers are priceless." - Xayah
"They make chaos dance." - Xayah
"All out of second chances. Sorry." - Xayah
"Listening. Such a simple concept." - Xayah
"Okay, so we're doing this." - Xayah
"Threading the needle." - Xayah
"Quit crying! It's just a feather." - Xayah
Xayah chants. - Xayah
"When I dance, I lead." - Xayah
"My last nerve is long gone." - Xayah
"A Vastayan feather is a kingly gift." - Xayah
"This was our world first." - Xayah
"Ever been stabbed by a feather?" - Xayah
"Yay, someone to throw knives at." - Xayah
"I leave nasty scars." - Xayah
"It's only a little prick." - Xayah
"Sabotage takes patience and time - and lots of feather daggers." - Xayah
"I'll do whatever needs to be done - twice, just to be sure." - Xayah
"Compromise is so unsatisfying." - Xayah
"Oh, I was born to ruffle feathers." - Xayah
"Our Vastayan essence fades with each passing day." - Xayah
"I will rest when our homelands are restored." - Xayah
"All women desire Rakan. Like they'd know what to do with him." - Xayah
"They say I don't know when to quit. Like that's a weakness." - Xayah
"We Vastaya are only half of our full glory." - Xayah
"Rebellion puts the fire in my blood." - Xayah
"No-one will block my path." - Xayah
"Talking to anybody about anything is never on my to-do list." - Xayah
"If our existence is everyone else's chaos, so be it." - Xayah
"Talking to people makes me want to stab them... so I do." - Xayah
"Victors are the sole authors of history. Time to write our chapter." - Xayah
"Tavern brawls just seem to find me." - Xayah
"Chaos is the preferred state of nature." - Xayah
"Nature bends towards chaos. Give in, or break." - Xayah
"I really hate anyone who's not me - or Rakan." - Xayah
"Nature is wild and untamed, not balanced." - Xayah
"Humans. They're so very blind." - Xayah
"Spiders are my spirit animal." - Xayah
"If Rakan were here, I'd make out with him until his ears bled. He loves it when I do that." - Xayah
"Ionians never learn." - Xayah
"Magic is not some river that can be easily channeled. It is a churning sea that goes where it pleases." - Xayah
"I hate flowers. Tiny skulls stuffed with twigs, on the other hand... " - Xayah
"Sometimes people die for a good cause - namely, mine. That's why I'm an optimist." - Xayah
"Cloudy days are my favorite." - Xayah
"I prefer to work at night, because, y'know, the sun? Bright? Yuck!" - Xayah
"Pandemonium follows me everywhere I go. It's like a puppy I once fed... " - Xayah
"Ionia used to be so nice - before humans tamed all that wild cataclysmic magic." - Xayah
"Once, magic was everywhere, or as the Vastaya say: (chants)" - Xayah
"Ionia's meddling birthed our rebellion." - Xayah
Xayah: "You remember the Affay waterfall?"	 Rakan: "Yeah?"	 Xayah: "I'd like to go there again."	 Rakan: "Well, try not to die then." - Xayah
"Damnit!" - Xayah
"I'm not laughing. I needed to say that just so you understand." - Xayah
"Next time, try using more hard 'k' sounds." - Xayah
"Ha ha ha." - Xayah
"Hahaha... I don't know what that is." - Xayah
"Behold. I am depleted of cares." - Xayah
"Just... no." - Xayah
"I'm about to ruin your day." - Xayah
"Please, for the sake of us both, go far away." - Xayah
"I'm going to murder you a thousand times." - Xayah
"Am I supposed to be intimidated right now? I'm not sure what's going on." - Xayah
"Please, don't make me tryhard. I'm not in the mood." - Xayah
"Can I just hate you to death?" - Xayah
"I can't even--- I don't know where to begin." - Xayah
"The next one to call me 'edgy' is getting choked to death." - Xayah
"I will punch your soul in the face." - Xayah
"Get out there and take a bullet for me - like a gentleman." - Xayah
"You're not bad for someone who isn't Rakan." - Xayah
"If we do this right, only one of us get shot." - Xayah
"Block the hits for me - please?" - Xayah
"Make me look good, and I'll make you look good, got it?" - Xayah
"How am I supposed to work with - whatever this is?" - Xayah
"Don't embarrass me." - Xayah
"Mages. Too insufferable to live." - Xayah
"Mages are lucky if they can cast a minor hex." - Xayah
"Yordles. Why did it have to be Yordles?" - Xayah
"Yordles are the reason no-one takes us Vastaya seriously." - Xayah
"Okay. Who invited the Yordle?" - Xayah
"You want to be mortal? You are mu'takl." - Xayah
"You betray your heritage, Ahri." - Xayah
"I don't want to spill Vastayan blood, Rengar." - Xayah
"We were not made to fight each other." - Xayah
"Aw, poor sad little mummy! I just want to take you home." - Xayah
"I don't want to hurt you, space dragon. We could be such good friends." - Xayah
"I can't wait to burst your bubble." - Xayah
"Who does your wardrobe? Fire them. Immediately." - Xayah
"Wait, magic powered sword legs? Is this a joke?" - Xayah
"Is this another timeline where I beat you up again?" - Xayah
"When I'm done with Ionia, I'll come for Demacia." - Xayah
"Where can I get one of those delightful katanic god-clutch purses? Does it come in purple? The god, not the bag." - Xayah
"I want your happiness to evaporate." - Xayah
"I want to travel the world with you." - Xayah
"But is it really okay?" - Xayah
"Your talking is not improving this wonderful silence." - Xayah
"You're gross. Never change." - Xayah
"You call that a rebellious nature?" - Xayah
"You call that being a vampire?" - Xayah
"I'm insulted? I don't know." - Xayah
"Ouch. I'm going to need some aloe." - Xayah
"I wasn't listening to what you said, but I sure am outraged." - Xayah
"Watch your tongue - and your back." - Xayah
"Say that to my feathers." - Xayah
"Get down with me!" - Xayah
"Aw, yeah, let's get down!" - Xayah
"Aw, yeah, come on!" - Xayah
"Alright, put your back in to it!" - Xayah
"Dust it off!" - Xayah
"Nope!" - Xayah
"Nuh uh!" - Xayah
"Sit down!" - Xayah
"Eat it!" - Xayah
"Didn't see that coming?" - Xayah
"Gotcha." - Xayah
"Pinned!" - Xayah
"Oops, your bad!" - Xayah
"Oops, your bad." - Xayah
Rakan: "You okay?"	 Xayah: "Better now." - Xayah
Rakan: "I got you!"	 Xayah: "Thanks, babe." - Xayah
Rakan blows a kiss.	 Xayah blows a kiss. - Xayah
Rakan: "You're welcome."	 Xayah: "Thank you." - Xayah
Xayah: "Thank you!"	 Rakan: "Any time!" - Xayah
"Thank you, honey!" - Xayah
Rakan: "That help?"	 Xayah: "Appreciated!" - Xayah
Xayah: "Aw, you're looking out for me!"	 Rakan: "Always." - Xayah
"Feathers fly!" - Xayah
"This is overpriced - but I must have it." - Xayah
"I want to buy all the things!" - Xayah
"I am totally pulling this off." - Xayah
"What the heck? I deserve it." - Xayah
"I know I'm being price gouged, but I'll splurge." - Xayah
"Where did you get all these wonderful things?" - Xayah
"Is this ethically sourced?" - Xayah
"Hook me up with that magical creature discount?" - Xayah
"Do I really need this? Ah... yes." - Xayah
"But how much does it cost for me?" - Xayah
"Good henchmen are hard to find." - Xayah
"Next." - Xayah
"Nothing is ever easy, but that was really easy." - Xayah
"That was too easy - but so much fun." - Xayah
"Don't feel bad, they're just magically animated sheets of cloth." - Xayah
"They mindlessly marched right to their deaths - like everyone in Noxus." - Xayah
"They dropped something. Their guard." - Xayah
"What? They were in my way." - Xayah
"As far as obstacles go, that was about a... three out of ten?" - Xayah
"Anyone else want to try?" - Xayah
"Thanks for the dance." - Xayah
"Few can keep up with me." - Xayah
"Alright, who's next?" - Xayah
"And an F, for effort." - Xayah
"Got what they deserved." - Xayah
"I'm overcome with emotion." - Xayah
"That was for the Vastaya." - Xayah
"Well, they tried to stop me." - Xayah
"Well, that's done." - Xayah
"Hm, dodging seems to be a weak spot of yours." - Xayah
"I warned you. Oh, wait, did I? Crap. My fault." - Xayah
"Yep. Easy peasy." - Xayah
Rakan: "That's my baby."	 Xayah: "Ah, it was nothing." - Xayah
Rakan: "Did I do that?"	 Xayah: "No. That was me."	 Rakan: "Who's counting?"	 Xayah: "Me. I'm counting." - Xayah
Rakan: "Miella, I helped, right?"	 Xayah: "Couldn't have done it without you, mieli." - Xayah
Rakan: "Every time you do that, it drives me crazy."	 Xayah: "Well. I'll have to do it more often, then." - Xayah
Rakan: "Were... they trying?"	 Xayah: "Probably, but there are two of us." - Xayah
Rakan: "I love watching you kill."	 Xayah: "I love killing for you."	 Rakan: "Let's make out." - Xayah
Rakan: "Haha! Told you!"	 Xayah: "Rakan, let's not gloat. Much." - Xayah
Rakan: "Did they deserve it?"	 Xayah: "They deserved it." - Xayah
Rakan: "Why do they break so easily?"	 Xayah: "They aren't made like us."	 Rakan: "Pity." - Xayah
Xayah: "That was a Vastayan farewell."	 Rakan: "Isn't a Vastayan farewell when you say, "ouulavaash?"	 Xayah: "I was trying to have a moment, Rakan." - Xayah
Rakan: "Did you see that? Haha! That was amazing!"	 Xayah: "Nice job, babe." - Xayah
Rakan: "They couldn't keep up with you."	 Xayah: "Only you can, Rakan." - Xayah
"Too bad those tails weren't lives." - Xayah
"We asked you to join." - Xayah
"This is by your design." - Xayah
"The Vastaya will sing songs of you. I promise." - Xayah
"Mu'takl." - Xayah
"Shame. You could have been so useful alive." - Xayah
"Every drop of Vastayan blood spilled is a waste." - Xayah
"Taitah be tervaash." - Xayah
"It needed to be done." - Xayah
"Wasn't she just a ray of sunshine? I hate sunshine." - Xayah
"And that's where plucky optimism gets you." - Xayah
"Hurray, they all died." - Xayah
"It's more of a slaughter than a massacre, really." - Xayah
"I wish they could have seen the looks on their faces." - Xayah
"Maybe I overdid it." - Xayah
"I wasn't joking when I said nothing stands in my way." - Xayah
"A victory for the Vastaya." - Xayah
Rakan: "Heh, like this... " Rakan sings. - Xayah
Rakan sings.	 Xayah: "Oh, here we go again. Mhm. Mister Scatman, uh huh. ... oh, he's got me going now... "	 Rakan: "Sing it with me, baby."	 Xayah: "I don't know the words." - Xayah
Xayah groans. - Xayah
"Magic is again unfettered." - Xayah
"Untied that mystical knot." - Xayah
"Another minor annoyance reduced to rubble." - Xayah
"Crumble! Yes!" - Xayah
"I could dance right now. Aw, but there's more work to be done." - Xayah
"Can you feel the magic flowing? I can." - Xayah
"Sabotage looks so good on me." - Xayah
"I've been known to implode a sacred obelisk or two." - Xayah
"I will unblock the rivers of Vastayan essence." - Xayah
"Each totem that falls strengthens the Vastayan cause." - Xayah
"We rise." - Xayah
"Another Vastayan victory." - Xayah
"They should really get a refund from those masons." - Xayah
"Hm, poor construction. No standards." - Xayah
"Shoddy construction, through and through." - Xayah
"Help!" - Xayah
"Yipes!" - Xayah
"Oh crap, oh crap!" - Xayah
"Somebody?" - Xayah
"Oh no, oh no!" - Xayah
"SOS!" - Xayah
"I don't like this!" - Xayah
"This is bad!" - Xayah
"Oh, hell nope!" - Xayah
"Danger zone!" - Xayah
"Watch it!" - Xayah
"Be safe!" - Xayah
"Look out!" - Xayah
"Something here!" - Xayah
"Not good!" - Xayah
"Beware!" - Xayah
"That ain't good!" - Xayah
"Spooky." - Xayah
"Danger!" - Xayah
"Where are they?" - Xayah
"Where'd they go?" - Xayah
"They missing?" - Xayah
"They ain't here." - Xayah
"Nobody's here." - Xayah
"What's going on?" - Xayah
"What's happening?" - Xayah
"Mysterious mystery!" - Xayah
"They gone?" - Xayah
"Heads up!" - Xayah
"On my way!" - Xayah
"Coming, love!" - Xayah
"On the way!" - Xayah
"Heading over!" - Xayah
"Running over!" - Xayah
"Bringing the show!" - Xayah
"Bringing the fun!" - Xayah
"I'mma coming, I'mma coming!" - Xayah
"There in a sec!" - Xayah
"I must know their every move." - Xayah
"Sometimes, I have to watch my own back." - Xayah
"Eyeball in the grass." - Xayah
"I need a strategic viewpoint." - Xayah
"Let's have a look-see, shall we?" - Xayah
"This is ambush territory." - Xayah
"I never walk into a trap unprepared." - Xayah
"I hate surprises - unless I'm doing the surprising." - Xayah
"See the enemy, know their mind." - Xayah
"Rebellions thrive on intelligence." - Xayah
"And they won't be needing that any more." - Xayah
"Die, little inanimate spy." - Xayah
"Found one! Killed it." - Xayah
"Good thing I didn't do anything embarrassing." - Xayah
"There's more than one way to blind an enemy." - Xayah
"Well, that's just an invasion of privacy." - Xayah
"I'm going now. Where? Anywhere not here. That's where." - Xayah
"Well, I'm bored." - Xayah
"Bored now." - Xayah
"We gotta go." - Xayah
"Wait for me!" - Xayah
"Xayah out." - Xayah
"Don't leave without me!" - Xayah
"You going somewhere?" - Xayah
"Why not?" - Xayah
"Aw... crap... " - Xayah
"Rakan... " - Xayah
"Seriously...?" - Xayah
"Uh, seriously...?" - Xayah
"Ugh, lame... " - Xayah
"Death was a nice vacation from the tedium - but nothing good can last, I suppose." - Xayah
"Death was nice and peaceful. Thanks for ruining it." - Xayah
"I always wanted to be buried and resurrected in this outfit." - Xayah
"Oh, I wasn't finished with these fools yet." - Xayah
"A day away from my forge is a day wasted." - Ornn
"All I need is myself, and... hammer." - Ornn
"Enough!" - Ornn
"Hold still!" - Ornn
"An iron will must be forged!" - Ornn
"Good! Yes!" - Ornn
"I will hit you until minerals fall out!" - Ornn
"Eugh- Even my beard is angry!" - Ornn
"Anvil time!" - Ornn
"Hold my ale." - Ornn
"That's a whompin!" - Ornn
"This is called building character." - Ornn
"Nose! Meet grindstone!" - Ornn
"This will ring nicely!" - Ornn
"Ahhh, hitting relieves stress." - Ornn
"Fighting is my first language." - Ornn
"You are a nail." - Ornn
"I have a hard head." - Ornn
"I was working!" - Ornn
"The work is the reward!" - Ornn
"Now this I like!" - Ornn
"Hammer never fails." - Ornn
"You like that? I do!" - Ornn
(Grunts) - Ornn
"I don't like the look of that thing." - Ornn
"We never talk, might as well fight!" - Ornn
"Your sword has no counterbalance!" - Ornn
"Give me the ale and no one gets hurt." - Ornn
"Stop building!" - Ornn
"My hammer is better." - Ornn
"I do not like you." - Ornn
"This is for my followers!" - Ornn
"It is childish to favor one tool over another, but hammer is my favorite." - Ornn
"Humans have done some things right: beer, dark beer." - Ornn
"Once a human kneels, they rarely stand again." - Ornn
"My forge is my home." - Ornn
"I do not need company, only wall, to keep out company." - Ornn
"Once I made a harpoon out of a mountain and a world tree. That was a weird century." - Ornn
"Bah, look at all these lazy trees." - Ornn
"Backbreaking labor is life's greatest pleasure." - Ornn
"The other gods don't understand me. Hmph, good." - Ornn
"The last time I ate a plant was never." - Ornn
"My work speaks in the roar of flame and the ringing of steel." - Ornn
"I will make an axe that is also a sword. And possibly a spoon." - Ornn
"Everything is better when it is molten. Lead, iron, chocolate cake." - Ornn
"I had followers once, they tried." - Ornn
"Luck is failure that failed." - Ornn
"I enjoy being alone, fewer unintended casualties." - Ornn
"The Freljord forges men out of... whatever children are. Dirt, goblins." - Ornn
"Ornn builds things, go see Ornn. Nobody ever says thank you." - Ornn
"This world has potential. Need hammering." - Ornn
"Gods do not need followers. Followers need gods." - Ornn
"Solitude always meets my expectations." - Ornn
"(Grunts)" - Ornn
"(Grumbles)" - Ornn
"The best meal is a herd of cattle, with dark beer, and cherries... Mmm..." - Ornn
"I'm going this way. Do not follow me. Please." - Ornn
"I made this hammer. It was so good I named it... Hammer." - Ornn
"I will go over there, it looks quiet, it will be nice." - Ornn
"Name's Ornn, no further pleasantries needed." - Ornn
"I have fur. It is soft. Do not hug me." - Ornn
"The Freljord is a place for building, fighting, and eating. Home, sweet home." - Ornn
"If all goes well, our paths will never cross again. It never goes well." - Ornn
"(Sniffs) Singed fur... Jealous blood... My brother is near!" - Ornn
"Volibear is near... Everyone seek shelter!" - Ornn
"I cannot choose my brother, only the weapons to slay my brother." - Ornn
"Hmm... Noxian Granite. Respectable choice." - Ornn
"Walls are fine." - Ornn
"Could do without the statues." - Ornn
"Decent stonework." - Ornn
"Huh, loose cobblestone. We'll fix later." - Ornn
"The architecture here is not wholly terrible." - Ornn
"Hmm, this river needs a dam." - Ornn
"I did not want to cool off, but this feels nice." - Ornn
"Volibear made the first river. You do not want to know how." - Ornn
"Your job is not dying." - Ornn
"You remind me of a young me, who is less impressive." - Ornn
"Huh, you are not entirely an arse." - Ornn
"Working with you is almost like working alone. Almost." - Ornn
"Something you should know about me...(Long grumble)." - Ornn
"I do not care at all." - Ornn
"This is a waste of my time." - Ornn
"(Annoyed grunt)" - Ornn
"(Sigh) I do not care at all." - Ornn
"(Hums)" - Ornn
"Buy a joke book. And a clown." - Ornn
"I now like you less, I did not think that was possible." - Ornn
"Stop it." - Ornn
"No." - Ornn
"Good... Yes..." - Ornn
"I taught Doran everything he knows." - Ornn
"Ahh." - Ornn
"Hey... You... Go to the store." - Ornn
"You're welcome. - Ornn
"I made you something." - Ornn
"My work is ready." - Ornn
"My handiwork is for sale." - Ornn
"Come. See what I built." - Ornn
"Do not hang that on a wall." - Ornn
"I trust you know how to use that." - Ornn
"No exchanges." - Ornn
"If you want a weapon, here's a weapon. If you want conversation, here's a weapon." - Ornn
"Do not waste that." - Ornn
"You will not be disappointed." - Ornn
"Ornn tested, Ornn approved." - Ornn
"This does not mean we are friends." - Ornn
"A good axe will fell a tree, a great axe will fell an army." - Ornn
"The weapons I forge do not have names, they have ambitions." - Ornn
"That's a weapon. Y'know, for fighting." - Ornn
"You may be worthy of that. Do not prove me wrong." - Ornn
"That is what good looks like." - Ornn
"That is for wielding, not for entertaining." - Ornn
"I was looking at that one too." - Ornn
"I didn't make that, you didn't buy it." - Ornn
"Heheh, broke that real good." - Ornn
"Easy build, easy break." - Ornn
"Mortal craftsmanship, please." - Ornn
"Whoops. Found a flaw." - Ornn
"Shattered and melted." - Ornn
"A strong sneeze would've had the same effect." - Ornn
"Bad workmanship." - Ornn
"Demolished! Easy." - Ornn
"Barely touched it." - Ornn
"That's done." - Ornn
"Job complete." - Ornn
"Mhmm, yup, dead." - Ornn
"It has not been a pleasure." - Ornn
"Character built." - Ornn
"Ahhh." - Ornn
"Well, that happened." - Ornn
"Nailed it." - Ornn
"Job Done! Time to go home." - Ornn
"Back to work." - Ornn
"That was more fun than I expected." - Ornn
"Fixed!" - Ornn
"That fixed everything." - Ornn
"Problems solved." - Ornn
"Too much sorcery, not enough elbow grease." - Ornn
"Heh, not one of mine." - Ornn
"Build it again. Correctly." - Ornn
"Honestly though, I was just leaning on it." - Ornn
"It's always the magic parts that break." - Ornn
"I've seen sturdier sandcastles." - Ornn
"Hmph, nevermind." - Ornn
"Changed my mind." - Ornn
"Hmm, cherry flavored. Not bad." - Ornn
"Fuel for the old hearth-fire." - Ornn
"Whatever this drink is made of, it is working." - Ornn
"That hit the spot." - Ornn
"Hey, this is pretty good stuff." - Ornn
"Mmm, I do not like surprises." - Ornn
"Hmm, that all it does? Okay." - Ornn
"You stay here." - Ornn
"Is it on?" - Ornn
"(Grunts) I do not know how to feel about this thing, but okay." - Ornn
"Not on my watch." - Ornn
"Spy on that." - Ornn
"Denied." - Ornn
"Heheh, broke it real good." - Ornn
"There, fixed that for you." - Ornn
"Early warning is key." - Ornn
"Was like that when I found it" - Ornn
"(Grumbles) We're ready Ornn... we'll be right behind you..." - Ornn
"Just leave everything to me as usual." - Ornn
"Good job everyone." - Ornn
"I'm used to this level of disappointment." - Ornn
"Fine! I will intervene!" - Ornn
"Fire up the forge!" - Ornn
"Horns first!" - Ornn
"Into the fray!" - Ornn
"Turn up the heat." - Ornn
"Ugh, everyone get behind me!" - Ornn
"We fight now!" - Ornn
"This will be fun!" - Ornn
"Ready for this?!" - Ornn
"A fight's where I want to be." - Ornn
"A good workman is needed." - Ornn
"I swear, if Volibear is there..." - Ornn
"Time to show them the horns." - Ornn
"Efficient travel method. I approve." - Ornn
"Hmm, this is fast, but it can't be good for you." - Ornn
"I prefer walking... but, fine." - Ornn
"I'll just drop by." - Ornn
"They won't be ready for me." - Ornn
"I love a surprise." - Ornn
"I'm on my way. Stop asking." - Ornn
"You requested my aid!" - Ornn
"Hooooold!" - Ornn
"Hoold!" - Ornn
"My horns are on the way!" - Ornn
"Don't start without me!" - Ornn
"You each owe me a beer!" - Ornn
"Hot stuff!" - Ornn
"Incoming!" - Ornn
"I didn't die, my forge missed me." - Ornn
"Still no water in the fountain." - Ornn
"Rekindled the old furnace." - Ornn
"Well done." - Ornn
"I broke my beard!" - Ornn
(Groans) - Ornn
